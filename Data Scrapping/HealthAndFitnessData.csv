HealthAndFitness,1080,"Our bodies are very smart when it comes to surviving under harsh conditions. A fantastic — and somewhat infamous example — is adaptive thermogenesis, more commonly known as “starvation mode.” 
But what is “starvation mode” and what role does it play in a weight loss journey? Here’s what you need to know.
Is ‘Starvation Mode’ a Real Phenomenon or Just a Myth?
The concept of starvation mode is simple: If you don’t eat enough, your body will believe you’re starving. In turn, your body may maintain some of your weight and fat as an attempt to preserve energy, making it harder for you to lose weight.
“Starvation mode” only happens when a substantial caloric deficit is maintained for an extended period. While the exact timeline will vary depending on several factors, one study shows that it can happen after about a week of an extreme daily caloric restriction.
Symptoms of “starvation mode”
There’s just no getting around it. Your body needs calories to work correctly.
If you don’t eat enough, your body will slip into “adaptive thermogenesis,” the scientific term for “starvation mode.” This will slow your whole metabolism down, causing several side effects that will become more and more noticeable the longer you maintain the calorie deficit.
Here’s a quick rundown of the most common “starvation mode” symptoms:
Lethargy
Constipation
Depression
Inability to concentrate
Feeling unusually cold
Reduced appetite
The exact symptoms may vary from person to person but are usually accompanied by a general decrease in your weight loss rate. If you start experiencing any of these side effects, contact a doctor or nutritionist as soon as possible.
“Starvation mode” and its impact on weight loss
When in “starvation mode”, your metabolic rate may decrease significantly, especially if you lose too much weight too quickly. Metabolic rate refers to the number of calories you burn daily, making it crucial to the caloric intake and outtake formula.
The exact numbers will vary depending on how fast you lose body weight, but a good rule of thumb is that adaptive thermogenesis will kick in after about one week of severe caloric restriction, which is restricting total daily energy intake to be below basal metabolic rate (BMR).
BMR is the amount of energy in calories your body needs just to do the basics—breathing, circulating blood, regulating body temperature, and repairing cells—when at rest. Think of it as the calories you’d burn if you stayed in bed all day. It’s affected by things like your age, sex, weight, height, body composition, and even genes. 
And, according to registered dietitian and scientific advisory Scott Keatley, 1,200 calories is the absolute bare minimum a human body needs daily. (Aka, the lowest BMR you can have). “Even someone under 5 feet and 100 pounds needs more if they do anything beyond blink,” he says. 
Is intermittent fasting the same as starvation?
No, intermittent fasting is different from “starvation mode.”
First, fasting is only done for a predetermined amount of time, preventing you from going into adaptive thermogenesis.
To put it simply, fasting is a controlled, short-term caloric deficit, while starvation mode is an automatic mechanism that kicks in during long-term, low-calorie diets.
Intermittent fasting can be beneficial to some, providing several health benefits, such as reducing oxidative stress and boosting brain function. Starvation mode, on the other hand, is a sign of damage to your body due to an extended caloric deficit. Remember, consult with your physician before starting any new diet regime, including intermittent fasting, to ensure it is right for you.
There is a lot of anecdotal evidence that intermittent fasting has helped people lose weight alongside a healthy, whole food diet. 
What are some of the dangers of prolonged and very low-calorie diets?
The first — and maybe most frustrating — side effect of low-calorie diets is that “starvation mode” can cause your weight loss rate to stall. This can quickly become a catch-22: You eat less because you’re not losing weight, and you don’t lose weight because you’re not eating enough.
Over time, starvation can also cause your muscle mass to decrease due to the overall reduction of calories, weight, and energy. Similarly, your overall body temperature will drop.
A body in “starvation mode” for extended periods is also more vulnerable to illnesses and wounds. The risk of anxiety, irritability, and depression also rises, and you may even develop feelings of guilt and shame surrounding food.
Here are some other long-term “starvation mode” side effects:
Reduced heart muscle size
Reduced blood pressure
Social withdrawal
Changes in your menstrual cycle
Impaired immune system
Weak bones
If you think you may be in starvation mode, we suggest you notify your doctor right away.
Guiding Principles of Healthy Weight Loss Efforts
Let’s face it — losing weight can be challenging. A desperation to lose weight quickly can lead to decisions that may work in the short term but are harmful in the long run.
You should avoid an aggressive approach to weight loss at all costs, as it will often lead you to patterns like yo-yo dieting. Instead, we think the best approach to weight loss is adopting healthy nutritional and lifestyle decisions you can maintain long-term.
This includes exercise, one of the main pillars of weight loss. Moderate exercise can greatly contribute to your losing weight while also keeping your body and mind healthy and active. But even light exercise can help!
You may also want to consider your current eating habits. Do you often find yourself snacking away through the night? Do you eat more when you’re anxious and stressed? Taking note of these habits can help you find common pitfalls in your diet and avoid unnecessary weight gain.
We recommend you keep a food diary to identify any possible patterns. If you’re not too keen on using pen and paper, MyFitnessPal features an extensive food diary with many features to help you start correcting your eating habits ASAP!
Increase Your Metabolic Rate To Lose Weight With a Healthy Diet
If you lose too much weight too quickly, your metabolic rate will decrease, making your weight loss journey much more difficult.
That’s why it’s crucial to follow a healthy weight loss plan that maintains (or even increases) your metabolic rate through exercise and a well-balanced diet. With several useful tools — such as a calorie tracker and food diary — the MyFitnessPal app is the perfect companion for all your weight loss efforts!

HealthAndFitness,1494,"Regular physical activity is vital for anyone trying to lose or maintain a healthy weight.
You can do many things that burn body fat, create a calorie deficit, and help you get in shape. The real question is: Which cardiovascular exercise is best for weight loss?
Swimming, cycling, and running are all excellent workouts if you do them consistently. But if you enjoy running you’re in luck, running can be a great way to burn calories and promote weight loss. Compared to these other forms of exercise, one study shows that running burns more calories per mile, because it takes more time to run a mile rather than biking.
If you’re starting your journey to better health and are considering running for weight loss, this guide will provide seven easy tips that will have you up and running (pun intended) before you know it.
Can You Lose Weight and Belly Fat by Running?
Yes, you can.
But note that it’s impossible to specifically go running to lose belly fat because that’s not how exercise works. You can do crunches all day to strengthen your abdomen, but the only way to shrink your belly is by losing overall body fat, and running is a terrific option.
Of course, going for a run isn’t the only effective way to lose weight. For example, this 20-minute high-intensity interval training can help torch calories even faster.
But if you prefer less intense exercise levels, running is a great way to go.

What does science have to say?
A decade ago, the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory released a study showing the positive correlation between running and weight loss. More recently, a Czech study of over 1,000 adult runners confirmed earlier findings, concluding that a regular running workout to lose weight improves physical fitness. It does this by significantly reducing body fat under the skin as well as around your organs.
Translation: Jogging for weight loss works.
So, if you’re a beginner determined to lose weight running, keep reading to learn how to start racking up the miles and shedding pounds in no time.
6 Easy Tips for Running To Lose Weight
When you’re focused on a long-term goal, the little details matter. Use these strategies to get the most out of your runs.
1. Consider the different types of running and their benefits
Not all runs are created equal. So before you lace up, it’s good to know about the different types, their benefits, and which are best for beginners running for weight loss.
Jogging: At an average pace of 4 mph to 6 mph, jogs are easy on the joints and cardiovascular system, making them perfect for beginners starting a new routine.
Running: Beyond 6 mph, you’re officially running! If you’re a beginner, it may take a few months to progress from jogging to running, but with consistency, everyone gets there. Since running gets the heart going faster than jogging, it’s also more effective for weight loss.
Interval sprinting: Sprinting between intervals of jogging or running is a more intense workout that burns calories faster. Although runners at any level can benefit from interval sprinting, beginners should ease into it, keeping the frequency of these workouts to no more than three days per week.
Long-distance running: Running a longer distance for a longer period of time can lead to more calories burned (a single run of 10 or more miles can burn 1,000 calories). However, it’s vital that beginners slowly build up to a long-distance exercise program so their bodies can adjust.
Outside vs. the treadmill: Depending on preference, you can do any of the above runs outside or on a treadmill. Treadmills allow for a more controlled environment to monitor your pace and distance but can make for a duller exercise. On the other hand, running outside provides lots of visual stimulation, but keeping your pace consistent is more challenging.
2. Eat a healthy diet to support this form of exercise
Some new runners are so focused on losing weight that they make critical fueling mistakes — such as not eating enough carbs — that can impede their long-term goals.
That’s why one of the best ways to lose weight from running is to combine it with a diet that supports physical activity.
Find the ideal pre-workout meal: Before your run, choose a light snack that balances carbohydrates and protein, such as a banana with peanut butter or a small portion of oatmeal. At the same time, avoid unnecessary discomfort by not eating anything high in fat or fiber, such as fried foods, red meat, beans, or berries.
Learn what and when to eat after your workout: Post-run nutrition is just as important. You don’t want to eat more calories than you’ve just burned, but you need to replenish your muscles with protein and carbohydrates to refill energy and promote recovery.
Plan your meal timing right: Eating 60 to 90 minutes after a workout is when the body is most effective at replacing carbohydrates and promoting muscle growth and repair. Low-sugar smoothies with fruit and whey protein or this zucchini hummus chicken wrap are two great choices.
3. Start slow until you reach runner’s high
If you’ve never run before or aren’t used to regular exercise, it’s normal to be intimidated at first.
The good news is you don’t have to start with running. First-timers can begin by simply walking every day. For some people, a half-hour walk may even burn more fat than a thirty minute workout.
Starting slow has the added benefits of being more enjoyable and sustainable while minimizing the risk of injury. As you get more comfortable and your body adjusts to the new exercise routine, you can slowly progress from walking to running.
Once you’re running on a regular basis, there’s something else to look forward to.
You’ve probably heard of the euphoric experience during long runs caused by the brain releasing endorphins and neurochemicals. Good news: Runner’s high is a real thing.
Although you aren’t likely to hit a “runner’s high” as a beginner, it’s something to look forward to as you slowly build up the pace, frequency, and distance of your runs.
Fun fact: 5,720 workouts are tracked per minute in the MyFitnessPal app.
4. Make sure you stay hydrated
Every runner needs to stay hydrated, but it’s crucial for beginners demanding more from their bodies.
Hydration provides energy, improves performance, affects mood and breathing, and may even increase your metabolic rate. The risks associated with dehydration range from minor headaches and cramping to severe complications such as heart disease and heat stroke. Apps like MyFitnessPal are incredibly useful for beginners since they help you track your hydration throughout the day.
5. Create a running plan and stick to it
Going for a run is a great workout, but you’re unlikely to see any changes in your current weight without consistency.
One way to keep yourself on track is to create a running schedule to lose weight. Whether you start with one or two runs per week or choose a more frequent routine, staying disciplined will help your body adjust faster.
Regardless of your weight loss running plan, stick to your schedule and be consistent in order to make the most of your running for long-term improvement. With MyFitnessPal, you can factor the calories you lose during a run into your daily caloric goals, giving you an extra boost of motivation to get out there and hit the pavement.
6. Complement physical activity with diet
Yes, we mentioned it, but it’s worth repeating the importance of a balanced, nutritious diet to complement physical activity.
Some people are so excited to see results when they start running that they try to accelerate their weight loss by eating less. Methods such as yo-yo dieting aren’t sustainable and can have a negative impact, including regaining all the weight lost running.
7. Remember to get adequate sleep
Finally, getting enough sleep each night is a health benefit that directly impacts weight loss by regulating metabolism and appetite, improving running endurance, and keeping hunger hormones in check. With sleep features, MyFitnessPal can also provide invaluable insights about your sleep patterns, helping you optimize your sleep by identifying foods inhibiting sleep.

HealthAndFitness,1362,"Are you tired of second-guessing your portion sizes, wondering whether you’re eating too much or too little? You’re not alone!
Portion control is essential to maintaining a healthy lifestyle, and it’s high time we take the mystery out of knowing how much to eat. In this guide, we’re digging into the science of portion control and giving you five easy ways to manage your food intake. Time to discover the secrets to a balanced and healthy diet!
Understanding Food Portions
It turns out that we’re better at eating everything on our plates than our mothers thought we were. So, if we overserve ourselves too often, we may end up gaining unwanted weight. That’s why we’re giving you the scoop on portion sizes, and why taming them can be your secret weapon against overeating.
What’s the difference between portion and serving sizes?
Before we discuss portion control strategies, we need to clear up the difference between portion and serving sizes.
Serving size: A standardized amount used for nutritional information
Portion size: The amount of food you choose to eat
You know those nutrition facts labels you find on the back of every food package? Think of them like cheat codes for deciphering what you’re eating. The serving size is the recommended amount for one serving. Whether it’s a cup of cereal, a piece of chicken, or a handful of nuts, the serving size sets the stage for the rest of the nutritional details.
Sizes of foods can be so inconsistent—just think about the last piece of fruit you ate—so having standard serving sizes makes sense. If you eat a larger portion, you need to do some math to determine what you’re actually consuming.
For example, suppose you’re making a sandwich with two slices of bread. Look at the bread’s nutrition facts label. If it says that a serving size is only one slice, you’ll need to double the calories, sugar, etc. to accurately track what you’re eating.
Can you lose weight by cutting portion sizes?
Wondering if downsizing your portions can help you lose weight? Good news: It absolutely can! If you consume fewer calories than what your body needs, your body taps into its stash of stored fat. That means you’ll be burning fat, which leads to weight loss.
Scientific studies consistently support the idea that reducing portion sizes for weight loss can make a difference. This proves it’s not only about quality—although that’s important, too—but also about quantity. Just don’t cut too many that you’re body goes into “starvation mode.”
Can you gain weight by increasing portions?
On the flip side, consistently consuming larger portions can help if you’re trying to gain weight. When you up your portions, you’re giving your body more fuel to work with, which can help you pack on those desired pounds.
The key is to make sure you’re increasing portions with nutritious, calorie-dense foods to support your overall health while achieving your weight gain goals. Think hearty servings of healthy fats, lean proteins, and complex carbohydrates to help you gain weight in a healthy way.
5 Easy Ways To Calculate and Control the Size of Your Portions
Portion control is a secret ingredient in your recipe for a healthier lifestyle. So, let’s explore five effective ways to master the art of portion control to manage your intake of calories, essential macronutrients, and micronutrients.
1. Use a small plate as a portion control guide
Here’s how to fill your plate for healthy portion control:
Vegetables: Fill half your plate with colorful raw or cooked vegetables. You can mix in a small portion of fruit on this half of the plate, too.
Proteins: Reserve a quarter of the plate for lean meats like chicken or other protein foods like beans.
Carbohydrates: The remaining quarter can be dedicated to whole grains or starchy vegetables.
Choosing a smaller plate that measures 9 inches (23 cm) across may help you keep portions in check..
2. Avoid eating directly from food packages
Ever find yourself mindlessly munching straight from a bag of chips? Guilty as charged, right? Getting those snacks onto a plate or into a bowl can help.
By portioning your snacks, you’re controlling calories without depriving yourself. This simple step prevents you from losing track of how much you’re eating.

3. Measure a balanced diet’s portions using your hand
Say hello to your built-in visual portion size guide, aka your hands! Turns out they’re pretty clever when it comes to estimating portions. Let’s break it down with an average adult fist in mind:
Proteins: The palm of your hand is an ideal serving size of meat or a plant-based protein portion.
Fruits and vegetables: Aim for a fist-sized fruit portion or starchy veg, but a portion of vegetables like leafy greens can be a bit larger.
Carbohydrates: For your pasta, rice, or quinoa, a single portion is about one cupped handful.
Fats: Limit fats to the tip of your finger.
Using your hand as a rough guide at every meal simplifies portion control and helps you keep tabs on the types of macronutrients (carbs, proteins, fats) your body needs for overall health.
You can even use your hand to approximately figure out the serving sizes you’ll find on a Nutrition Facts label without digging out the measuring cups:
1 cup: your fist
1 tsp: your fingertip
1 tbsp: poker-chip-sized circle in the palm of your hand
3 oz (of meat): the palm of your hand
1-2 oz (of meat): cupped hand
1 oz (of meat or cheese): your thumb
4. Outsmart restaurant portions by cutting them in half
Let’s face it – sometimes restaurant portions are notorious for being on the larger side. But don’t fret! There are ways to enjoy eating out while avoiding overeating and feeling bloated.
First things first, use the tips in this article to determine what your body needs. If you feel the portion you’re served is larger than what you need, box it up and take it home!
Splitting up a restaurant meal whatever way you want helps prevent unintentional calorie overload and gives you delicious leftovers for the next day. Less cooking? Yes, please!
5. Use a food diary or tracking app to control calorie intake
Harness the power of your smartphone to keep your calorie intake in check. We’re already glued to our phones all day anyway, right? So why not put that screen time to good use?
Fun fact: In 2023, MyFitnessPal members logged 4,889 meals per minute
Using a food diary app like MyFitnessPal is one of the best weight loss apps and fitness apps, helping nearly 1 million members reach their nutrition and fitness goals every year. Members use it as a calorie tracker and calorie counter to log their foods, and take advantage of the app’s food database that contains 18 million foods. It’s not just a free calorie counter app — it’s also the best calorie counter app for people who are looking to take back control of their health and fitness.
The Bottom Line
Let’s talk about keeping that scale in check while still enjoying your food! It’s like having your cake and eating it too — well, maybe just a thinner slice.
The secret is balancing your plate with a mix of tasty foods in just the right portions.
We’re not here to say, “Ditch this, ditch that.” It’s all about the variety. Why is this mix of foods so essential? It’s like giving your body a VIP pass to all the nutrients it craves. And it also keeps your taste buds happy!
Depriving yourself of what you crave can backfire, leading to that frustrating cycle of yo-yo dieting. By giving your body what it needs and what you want, all in the right portions — and keeping track! — you can lose weight sustainably.
Losing weight and maintaining a healthy weight isn’t about diet misery or locking up your favorite snacks. It’s about making friends with lots of different types of foods, keeping those portions in check, and living your best life.

HealthAndFitness,732,"TikTok has been the birthplace of many diet trends, from the fasting-focused 5:2 diet to the whole food-based Valencia diet. One of the latest to go viral is the 90-30-50 method, which is essentially a form of macro tracking. Some health influencers claim it has helped them lose weight, manage autoimmune diseases, and improve their hormones.
As with any fad diet that comes from social media, it’s important to dig into the science behind it before trying it out yourself. We spoke with registered dietitian Joanna Gregg, RD, to get her expert opinion and dig into whether or not the new trend is as effective as TikTok makes it out to be.
What the 90/30/50 method is
Rather than counting calories, the 90-30-50 method recommends tracking two macros (protein and fat) and fiber. According to a video by the creator of the diet, registered dietitian Courtney Kassis, it requires you to eat a minimum of the following:
90 grams of protein
30 grams of fiber
50 grams of fat
Benefits of the 90-30-50 method
While there isn’t any research specifically on the 90-30-50 method, there is plenty of evidence to generally support eating more protein, fiber, and healthy fats.
Balanced hormones: “A well-balanced diet at the right caloric level can result in better insulin sensitivity and balance in the hormones that contribute to hunger and satiety,” Gregg explains, citing research that emphasizes the importance of healthy fats in particular.
Reduced risk of chronic disease: Studies have shown that consuming fiber can play a big role in minimizing the risk of chronic diseases like hypertension, diabetes, and obesity. Gregg adds that a healthy diet, exercise, and a healthy weight are also factors. “If this method of eating leads to these outcomes it can be beneficial to your health,” she says.
Improved blood sugar: According to one study, eating a high-protein diet (40 percent of total calories from protein) or even just a medium-protein diet (21 percent) can improve blood sugar levels. Regulating your blood sugar is key in preventing long-term health issues like heart disease and diabetes.
Is the 90-30-50 method effective for weight loss?
While Gregg says she doesn’t necessarily see anything wrong with this way of eating, she stresses that weight loss always comes down to a caloric deficit (a.k.a. consuming fewer calories than you burn). “If eating the 90-30-50 method helps you control calories and puts you in a caloric deficit, it would likely result in weight loss,” she explains.
Keep in mind, too, that everyone’s body is different. “The amount a person’s body needs of each nutrient is largely determined by age, sex and activity level,” Gregg explains. If you aren’t sure how much you should be eating, the MyFitnessPal macro calculator is a good place to start.
How to do the 90-30-50 method
If you’ve decided the 90-30-50 method is something you want to try—and you’ve cleared it with your doctor—Gregg has a few tips to help you be successful.
“Piggyback” your new goals on top of current goals. “For instance, if your goal is to eat breakfast every morning, come up with a high protein, high fiber meal with some healthy fats, like a piece of wheat toast with avocado and egg,” she suggests.
Increase fiber gradually. If you aren’t currently eating anywhere near the suggested 30 grams of fiber, Gregg says to slowly up your intake by 5 grams every week to avoid bowel issues.
Prioritize whole foods. In theory, with this diet, you could eat whatever you want as long you hit the minimum numbers. However, Gregg recommends focusing on lean proteins (like chicken or fish), complex carbs (fruits, veggies, and whole grains), and healthy fats (like olive oil or avocado).
Track your food with the MyFitnessPal app. “The best way to know you’re hitting the minimums is to track!” Gregg explains. There’s even research that shows tracking your intake leads to better diet compliance and more weight loss. In the MyFitnessPal app, you can keep track of how much protein, fiber, and fat you’re eating every day (along with other nutrients and overall calories) and monitor where you can improve.
Even if you don’t follow the 90-30-50 method to the T, there are some good takeaways from it. “This diet could help people prioritize healthy foods over some less desirable ones,” Gregg says, adding that more fiber is something many of us could use."

In the beginning, Dillion wanted to lose weight. But his goals extended beyond that to non-scale victories, too. He wanted to improve his consistency and self-discipline; and unlock a new level of mental well-being through nutrition.
After just 100 days, he accomplished those goals and more. Read Dillion’s MyFitnessPal success story below to learn how starting with food supported his journey to weight loss and whole-person health.
1. Growing up, what was your relationship with food like?
Growing up in South Georgia, I was raised on fried chicken, corn bread, and so many more delicious but not so healthy options. Amazing sweets and sugary sweet tea are staples of southern cuisine. I would always clean my plate and go back for seconds, as I wasn’t aware of the impact portion sizes could have on my body and health.
2. What was your relationship with your weight?
I have always been active. I played sports in high school and would do other activities in my free time that kept me moving. I fell off my routine when I went to college and started gaining weight.
I was eating what was convenient instead of what was good for me. I was less physically active so that contributed to an increase in body fat and it made me feel terrible. I did not realize how terrible I felt until I decided to make a change.
3. What motivated you to start making healthy changes?
I wanted to become healthier for myself! I deserve to give myself the very best. We can either get through the day, or get something from the day. I am going to make the choice to get something from it.
I wanted to grow physically, mentally, and spiritually. I also have a beautiful wife Shanell, and two wonderful boys, Ayden and Daylen who I want to inspire to do the same! Get up and get after it!
4. What goals did you set for yourself at the beginning of your journey?
I slowly built on my goals and progress month-over-month:
Month 1: Track my nutrition and walk a lot more
Month 2: Track nutrition, cardio in the form of jogging, and moderate weight training
Month 3: Keep tracking nutrition, lift weights more intensely, and focus on building stamina.
5. When and how did you discover the MyFitnessPal app?
I discovered MyFitnessPal by watching a lot of my favorite YouTube channels that recommended ways to track calorie intake. MyFitnessPal checked all the boxes I was looking for when it came to what I wanted to keep data on.
6. What’s your favorite MyFitnessPal feature and why?
My favorite features are the Weekly Review and the quick adds of meals from day to day! It makes tracking calories and macros a breeze.
7. Can you describe a specific moment or experience that served as a turning point in your health journey—one that made you realize you were on the right path?
On day one, I struggled to run a quarter mile without breathing hard. On day 70, I pushed myself and ran 10 miles and felt great afterwards. Sometimes, I feel it is important to go beyond the limits we set on ourselves. On the other side of pain is growth.
This made me realize that what I thought was impossible was just my current perception of what I was able to do. With hard work, anyone can change that!
8. How has tracking your food impacted your eating habits and food choices?
Tracking my food has been the greatest thing! By far, nutrition has been the biggest factor in my journey. It makes you self-aware of how the foods you eat impact more than just your weight.
I could tell a difference in mood, gut health, and confidence. It made it easier to know I was meeting my protein goals and getting enough fiber in my diet. I could also compare and contrast, experiment, and analyze what foods at what times contributed to my energy levels.
9. What kind of changes did you see in your gut health?
Initially, my diet was high in processed foods, which often left me feeling sluggish and bloated. However, as I shifted towards whole, nutrient-dense foods, I noticed significant improvements. Incorporating a variety of fruits, vegetables, and probiotics not only aided in my weight loss but, I believe, also led to a more balanced gut microbiome. I noticed better digestion, less bloating, and an overall increase in energy. It was as if my body was thanking me for the switch to a cleaner, more mindful way of eating.

10. You mentioned you experimented — especially with foods that impacted your energy levels. How did you experiment, and what did you find?
Since I started incorporating more fruits, vegetables, and whole grains into my diet, I’ve noticed a remarkable boost in my energy levels. The vitamins, minerals, and dietary fiber in these foods have not only supported my overall health. I feel like they’ve also optimized my body’s energy production. This change has led to more sustained energy throughout the day. I don’t feel as much fatigue and sluggishness as I used to!
I’ve learned more about nutrition, in general. I now understand the importance of carbohydrates in fueling my workouts — carbs break down into glucose, which my muscles use as a primary energy source, especially during intense or prolonged physical activities. This has allowed me to perform better and push myself further in my fitness journey. It’s clear to me now how essential a balanced diet, rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, is for maintaining high energy levels and supporting my workout regimen.
11. Thinking back to the goals you set for yourself at the beginning of your journey, what goals have you achieved? (In other words, where are you now in your health journey?)
I started my journey at 194 lbs! Now, I am 154 lbs!*
12. What goals do you want to achieve next?
I am starting a new phase until April. I want to put on as much muscle as I can in that time period. MyFitnessPal is going to help me stay in a calorie surplus that will help me build muscle while keeping the body fat percentage from increasing along with it. It’s simple math that makes a big difference!
13. What have you learned about yourself during your health journey so far?
I have spent a lot of time with myself. I wake up early and get to the gym around 4 a.m. to minimize the amount of time I miss with my wife and kids. I have learned what discipline really is and how important consistency is. You have to push yourself, but listen to your body and value recovery. You want to be able to go hard every time you step foot in the gym.
14. How has this journey impacted your overall health and well-being, both physically and mentally?
I can’t tell you enough how much better I feel physically and mentally. I am more confident, have better stamina, more mobile, and have a better mood and mindset throughout the day! The physical progress is great but the mental health improvement, energy levels, and stress reduction is priceless.
15. And finally, what advice would you give to others who are considering using MyFitnessPal?
Set realistic goals, be consistent, and plan your meals a day before if you can. It makes things so much easier! I look forward to planning what I feed my body each day!
Dillion did it. You can do it, too. Take control of your health today with the (free!) MyFitnessPal app.
*As always, everyone’s weight loss story is different. Weight loss is hard work, and involves a healthy diet and exercise. Most people can expect to lose 1-2 lbs per week."
HealthAndFitness,1200,"Walking is finally getting the respect it deserves.
Yes, walking. It’s a low-cost and accessible form of exercise. But more importantly, it helps you live longer, promotes mental health, and makes for a healthier heart.
If you’re an avid walker and ready to take it up a notch, there’s a simple way to unlock even more health benefits: walking with weights.
Let’s take a look at the benefits of weighted walking and a few tips for getting in a productive walking workout.
Does Walking With Weights Burn More Calories?
So, does carrying weights while walking really burn more calories than regular walking? The simple answer is yes.
Let’s break it down:
Calories are a measure of energy.
Energy expenditure, or caloric expenditure, is the energy your body uses to maintain essential body functions.
Your total energy expenditure is determined by your body weight and composition — or resting energy expenditure — and physical activity.
And adding extra weight while walking means your body is working harder and using more energy — giving you a good calorie burn.
Sounds pretty easy, right? Is it safe, too? Let’s take a look.
Key Considerations When Walking With Weights
To do it safely, it’s not as simple as slipping on hand or ankle weights and hitting the pavement.
Completing a walking with weights workout can be risky. We’re talking potential injuries, back pain, or even a rise in blood pressure.
Of course, we recommend consulting your doctor before adding weights to walking, especially if you have a pre-existing health condition.
But if you have the green light and you’re ready to take your walking game to the next level, here are a few precautions you should take.
Use the right type and amount of weight
Before we get into the nitty gritty of each type of weight, let’s talk about how much weight you should carry while walking. Whether you’re using hand weights or ankle weights, don’t add more than 1% or 2% of your body weight.
If you’re a newbie, start with one-pound weights. If you’re a more advanced walker and ready for heavier weights, go big and grab the three-pounders.
So, what’s the best type of weight to carry during walking?
Using hand or ankle weights is your best bet. But it’s not without its risks.
Walking with dumbbells or hand weights can create a muscle imbalance and cause injuries in your wrists, elbows, shoulders, and neck.
Walking with ankle weights poses a similar challenge, and it all comes down to muscle activation. In this case, weighted walking activates your quads more than your hamstrings, taking a toll on your knees, hips, and back over time.
For both methods, the trick is to keep the weight light and maintain controlled and steady movements.
Limit your workout time
Don’t be fooled: Walking with weights is a heart-pumping cardio workout. And it should be treated as such.
That means starting small. If you’re just starting out, don’t wear your ankle weights for an extended period. Start with 10 to 15 minutes each day and gradually increase your time. As with any exercise program, doing too much too soon can lead to sore muscles and overuse injuries.
Keep your form in check
It all starts with the right posture. Bad posture while carrying additional weight can make you tire more quickly and even lead to common walking injuries.
Before you take your first step, make sure you’re standing tall, relaxing your shoulders, and focusing your gaze on the horizon.
Once you’re on the move, make sure you have proper form by:
Swinging from your shoulders
Keeping your head and neck aligned
Tightening your abs
Striking heel-first
And like other forms of cardiovascular exercise, your nutrition plays a major role in how your body responds to a walking-with-weights workout.
Top 4 Nutrition Tips To Support Walking With Weight Routines
1. Make sure you have the appropriate pre-workout meal
You can’t walk 60+ minutes with your stomach on E, especially when you’re carrying extra weight. But carb-loading isn’t the answer, either.
The best meals to eat before longer cardio workouts, like a longer weighted walk, include a good balance of macronutrients: carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. These meals should be eaten at least two to three hours before exercising.
But if you need an energy boost before your workout, find a snack with more simple carbohydrates (carbs that are easier to digest) than proteins or fats — and eat it about 30 to 60 minutes before your walk.
Try these nutrient-packed snack ideas to fuel your weighted walk:
Bagel with peanut butter
Banana or apple
Granola bar
Dried fruit
If your walk is less than an hour, stick to your normal eating patterns: it’s up to you whether you walk in a fed or fasted state.
2. Stay hydrated during your walking routine
If your weighted walk lasts less than an hour, carrying a water bottle is your best option. But water might not cut it for your more intense workouts, like a walk that lasts longer than an hour. Sports drinks are great for a walking workout in a hot or humid environment, as they help replenish what you lose during those workouts — like water, energy (glucose), sodium, and potassium — and even help you stay at it longer.
This is how often — and how much — you should hydrate for more intense and longer duration exercises, per The American Council on
Exercise:
17 to 20 ounces two hours before exercising
7 to 10 ounces every 10 to 20 minutes while exercising
8 ounces no more than 30 minutes after exercising
For a shorter, low-intensity walk, normal hydration patterns are best. For women, the amount of total water is about 11.5 cups per day, and for men, about 15.5 cups.
3. Enjoy a recovery meal at the appropriate time
The work doesn’t stop once the walk is over. Now it’s time to refuel your body with healthy carbs and proteins to replenish your energy (glucose) and repair your muscle tissue.
Here are some post-workout snack and meal ideas for a low-impact exercise like weighted walking:
Avocado toast with smoked salmon
Bowl of high-fiber, low-sugar cereal
Oatmeal with yogurt and berries
Scrambled eggs with spinach
Just be sure to refuel within two hours of your workout to reap the full benefits.
4. Consider including a smoothie for a post–walking workout meal
Maybe a short, low-intensity walking workout isn’t cutting it. If you opt for a longer weighted walk, drinking a smoothie with protein for an alternative post–workout meal is an easy way to speed up recovery and repair tired muscles.
Just be sure to drink the smoothie right after your workout to quickly replenish your energy and refuel those tired muscles.

HealthAndFitness,1062,"Your body weight doesn’t directly reflect your muscle mass or overall health. So, it shouldn’t solely decide your fitness goals.
Body recomposition encourages you to stop looking at the numbers on the scale and listen to your body’s needs. In doing so, you can learn how your body balances muscle with fat and how your habits contribute to it all.
What Is Body Recomposition?
Think of body recomposition as a deep dive into your body’s health. Instead of setting goals around how much you weigh, you aim to build muscle and shed fat by changing your habits and diet.
To do this, you’ll need to focus on your body’s composition — which covers lean muscle mass, body fat, and more. You can gauge this by studying your abdomen, skinfold, and stature.
Rather than set your sights on direct weight loss, body recomposition plans aim to help you eat healthier, build strength, and use your body’s existing resources.
This long-term process often incorporates additional practices, such as prioritizing high-protein meals with less fat.
Using a body recomp strategy to determine your diet and workout results may take some adjustment. But it’s generally better (and safer) than only measuring weight. This is because, by volume, muscle weighs more than fat. 
So, for example, you could shed 15 pounds of fat and build 15 pounds of muscle mass but see no difference on the scale. That’s body recomposition at work!
The body recomposition process explained
Body recomposition is a long-term process of turning fat into muscle — but this isn’t something you can half-commit to. You’ll need to focus on your nutrition, fitness plans, and other lifestyle choices.
Remember, every person’s body composition is unique. So, there’s no universal recomposition process. Some people aim for a toned physique, while others want a slim, muscular build. Whatever your goals are, body recomposition is all about healthily balancing your body mass.
Consider your own body and goals. Ask yourself what you’d like to get out of your new diet and fitness routine now — and then a year from now.
For instance, if you want to immediately bulk up your muscles, you might want to focus first on weight training and high-calorie meals. Then, you may rebalance your body with cardio-based workouts and calorie deficits.
Finding a healthy balance between fat reduction and muscle growth may take time. Your body will likely react to exercises and diets differently, so be ready to readjust your routine. For example, consider adding more calories and protein to your nutrition plan if you lose both fat and muscle weight.
Potential benefits of changing your body composition
Like any health journey, body recomposition has the potential to improve your life and health in countless ways. Some of the benefits of body recomposition include:
Mobility and strength: Healthy muscle gain improves your strength and physical capabilities. So, you’ll be less likely to “pull something” when lifting or moving quickly.
Improved metabolism: A higher muscle mass improves your metabolic rate As a result, you’ll naturally burn more calories throughout the day, even when doing nothing at all.
Lower risks of health concerns: A healthy body composition can reduce your risk of heart problems, diabetes, and other chronic health concerns. It can also improve your insulin sensitivity, immune system, and overall health.
Confidence: Using your body composition to determine your progress helps you identify easily overlooked results — such as an equal amount of burned fat and built muscle. Recognizing your success can boost your confidence and point you to your most beneficial workout regimes.
4 Tips To Help Guide Your Body Recomposition Journey
A healthy amount of muscle tissue requires a carefully planned diet and workout regimen. Check out our top strategies for your body recomposition journey, and as always, be sure to consult with your physician before starting any diet or exercise routine to ensure it is right for you.
1. High-protein diets promote muscle growth
How much protein you eat directly contributes to your muscle growth and how you maintain muscle mass. Some of the best recomp diets prioritize foods with high protein but low fat — especially after workouts. If you stay above the minimum recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for protein, you’re more likely to grow muscle rather than immediately burn all your calories.
Check out MyFitnessPal’s high-protein diet plan, or consider creating your own with the following foods:
Chicken
Turkey
Salmon
Eggs
Beans
Quinoa
Yogurt
Cottage cheese
2. Reducing caloric intake
Calories aren’t bad for you — they fuel your body. Of course, too much of a good thing can be harmful, so in some instances it may be helpful to cut back on your calories to lose fat and gain muscle through diet. Too few, and you may need to add more body recomp calories to effectively gain muscle.
Consider fitness and diet tools, such as MyFitnessPal, to track your personal calorie intake and body recomposition macros. These apps help you identify the best approach to your personal diet. For example, the macro calculator recommends your ideal calorie intake based on your age, height, weight, macro targets, and more.
3. Reducing body fat percentage with cardiovascular training
Aerobic and cardio exercises — anything that gets your heart rate going — can be some of the best body recomp workouts for cutting down fat. These exercises burn calories at a faster rate than traditional weight training.
Many fitness enthusiasts designate specific cardio days outside of their muscle-focused exercises. These cardio workouts burn through fat while giving their muscles a break. This process is essential for balancing your composition.
4. Including weight or resistance training in your routine
Weight and resistance training focuses on muscle gain and strength. Many body recomposition plans fluidly blend resistance and cardio-based exercises. Prioritizing both of these aspects can help you avoid losing or gaining too much weight at once.
As you go, you might identify specific weight training workouts, such as squats or power lifts, that meet your immediate goals. The MyFitnessPal app also recommends specialized workout routines, including full-body burn, fast fitness from home, and stretch and strengthening.
Find the Right Balance To Reach Your Fitness Goals
Balancing your diet and exercise goals can inform and motivate you when you’re just getting started. And, when in doubt, MyFitnessPal–the #1 nutrition and food tracking app—can help.

HealthAndFitness,1310,"If you’re like many people, you go from day to day at a frantic pace. From careers to workouts to social events, there’s a lot to pack into daily living.
Always being on the go can make you feel famished quickly and cause fatigue at the end of the day. But if you’re constantly overwhelmed by these feelings, your body might be giving you a signal.
If you wonder, “is my hunger or fatigue nutrition related” it’s time to find the root of the problem. So, we asked Joanna Gregg, a dietitian who works with MyFitnessPal.
8 COMMON REASONS FOR CONSTANT FATIGUE AND HUNGER
Hunger pangs and fatigue are no laughing matter. Here are eight possible causes of why you’re feeling tired and hungry all the time.
1. Skipped or unbalanced breakfast
Busy morning schedules can lead to rushing out the door without eating. Or, you might skip breakfast and grab a granola bar or smoothie on your way to work. This can leave you constantly wanting to eat throughout the day.
“Your brain is an energy hog. While you’re sleeping, your brain works hard to flush toxins, imprint memories, and make sense of new information,” says Gregg. “Your body is also on a fast for 8 to 10 hours. The last thing you want to do is deprive it of nourishment in the morning.”
That’s why you don’t want to skip breakfast in the morning. You can also enjoy a split breakfast with a small meal before working out and the rest as a post-workout snack.
Some research, done mostly on children and adolescents, has shown that eating breakfast enhances cognitive function and reduces brain fog.

2. Improperly fueled exercise
Physical activity is vital for good health, but too much of it too quickly can leave your body tired and hungry. If you are just starting a new activity or are dialing in on your current exercise nutrition, making sure you fuel appropriately is important to make sure you don’t crash later.
“Smaller amounts of proteins and fats can be helpful for intensive workouts to avoid insatiable hunger afterward,” says Gregg. “The post-workout meal should focus on a mix of long-lasting carbohydrates, proteins, and fats to replenish stores lost during exercise.”

3. Long hours without meals or snacks
Going too long between meals can lead to unhealthy food cravings. If you’re constantly hungry during the mid-morning and mid-afternoon, pay attention. Your body is telling you it’s not getting enough calories and overall nutrition.
Even when restricting calories to lose weight, incorporating healthy snacks is a great way to ensure you are fueled up and not starving come meal time. Nutrient dense snacks like fruits, veggies, nuts and seeds are a great way to help improve overall diet quality and help ward off hunger.
4. Lack of sleep
Do you tend to make poor food choices when you don’t get enough sleep? Research shows an association between sleep deprivation and a desire for unhealthy, weight gain promoting foods due to the inability of the brain to effectively control appetite and hunger stimuli.
Hunger hormones are greatly influenced by circadian rhythms. “Ghrelin and leptin are your hunger hormones, and they work together to balance energy, tell you when you’re full, and prepare you for a meal. They can also influence how much progress you make if you’re trying to lose weight,” explains Gregg.
If you’re low on sleep, your ghrelin levels increase and can lead to unnecessary hunger. Meanwhile, your leptin levels decrease. Without leptin giving you the right hunger signals, you are more likely to overeat. One study found an increase in energy intake between 200-500 calories per day in sleep deprived persons leading to excess intake and weight gain.
Severe calorie restriction is also associated with sleep interruptions so making sure you have enough caloric intake to fuel your body during sleep is important as well.

5. Nutrient lacking diet
“If your food intake lacks balanced nutrition, you’re likely to feel hungry and sluggish too soon after a meal,” advises Gregg.
Filling your diet with complex carbs such as legumes, whole grains and fruits and vegetables, healthy fats like nuts, seeds and avocado and lean proteins will help provide sustained energy throughout your entire day. Complex carbohydrates fuel your body and serve as the body’s most readily available energy source. Healthy fats give you energy and boost your cognitive functions. Finally, proteins provide long-lasting satiety, help build muscle health, and stabilize blood sugar levels.
It is important to choose meals and snacks that are nutrient dense and contain fiber to ensure blood sugar levels are sustained without peaks and drops. Foods with high amounts of sugar and little fiber, fat or protein cause blood sugar levels to rise immediately and then dip back down very quickly. Choose meals and snacks that have a combination of protein, fat, carbs and fiber in order to stabilize blood sugar and stave off hunger and fatigue throughout the day. (Unlock nutrition insights on your daily meals by logging them in MyFitnessPal!)
One study showed that people who experience significant drops in blood sugar in the hours between meals consumed ~300 more calories over the course of the day than people whose blood sugar remained steady.
6. Alcohol consumption
Drinking a lot of alcohol is hard on your liver, but it also affects your sleep cycles and appetite. Alcohol can make you tired initially and even lead to insomnia, disrupted REM sleep, and daytime sleepiness.
Another way alcohol affects you is through your appetite. High alcohol consumption leads to increased ghrelin hormones, which stimulate a desire for food. It leads you to eat more and drink more than you ordinarily would. Your self control is also usually inhibited when drinking, which makes choosing more palatable, low nutrient foods over healthy foods more likely.
7. Lack of proper hydration
When you don’t get enough hydration — whether after a workout or throughout regular activities — you can begin to experience fatigue and altered cognition.
Fatigue is one symptom of severe hydration which may be causing you to feel extra tired. The symptoms of dehydration are also very similar to those of hunger and you may overeat to try to make up for the loss of fluids.
8. High levels of stress
Acute and prolonged stress can be difficult and can lead to fatigue and alterations in many physiological functions including hormones that influence eating behaviors.
Some research found that people under stress opted for unhealthy, high fat foods instead of low fat, low sugar foods. Too much stress causes changes in cortisol levels leading to the desire for more palatable foods in place of nutrient dense, healthier foods. Over time the overconsumption of these unhealthy foods leads to weight gain.
ADDRESS THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEM AND IMPROVE YOUR OVERALL HEALTH
Feeling hungry and tired all the time can be frustrating. It could also be your body’s way of signaling something to you.
The causes of hunger and fatigue vary. The causes listed above are largely reversible and can improve with changes to your diet and lifestyle. However, some causes may be more serious and require medical attention. Once you address the issue, you can move forward with improving your health. Tracking your food intake on MyFitnessPal is a great way to ensure you are getting enough of the right foods to keep you performing at your best."
HealthAndFitness,1357,"If you’re familiar with nutrition and fitness, you’ve probably encountered the terms macronutrients — sometimes simply called “macros” — and micronutrients.
Focusing on macronutrients versus micronutrients might sound like a competition between advanced science topics, but in reality, it’s all pretty easy to understand. Macros are the main energy sources for your body and they make up the bulk of your diet. Micros are all the vitamins and minerals you see listed on nutrition information labels.
Tracking both types of nutrients is a good way to make sure you’re getting the nutrients you need for your nutrition and weight goals.
Macronutrients Explained
There are three macronutrients that make up the main nutritional elements that you need to fuel your body. They provide the energy your body needs for physical activities as well as for automatic functions like digestion and immune responses.
The three types of macronutrients are carbohydrates, fats, and proteins.
Many consider fiber a macronutrient as well, though it isn’t a source of fuel the way carbs, fats, and proteins are. Instead, fiber assists with body functions such as digestion.
How are macros measured?
Macronutrients are measured in grams. The gram measurements are a standard measure that appears on all nutrition labels. They correspond to the calorie value of each macronutrient:
4 calories in a gram of carbohydrate or protein
9 calories in a gram of fat
What is the function of macros in your body?
Macronutrients are the energy source for your body. Generally speaking, about 90% of your diet consists of macros, and they supply almost 100% of your energy.
Each macro undergoes a conversion process as your body digests it. The body converts macros into basic units of energy to build substances it needs for growth, healing, cellular maintenance, and activity.
Your body processes and uses each macro in a different way:
Carbohydrates convert to sugars. Carbs are a source of quick energy that your body can use for high-intensity activities.
Carbs are also crucial to brain function.
Proteins convert to amino acids. Your body uses protein to support tissue structure and hormone production systems. Your body can’t reserve protein for later use, so any excess protein you consume is converted to energy or stored as fat.
Fats convert to fatty acids and glycerol. Fat is used for strengthening cellular structures and protecting organs. It’s also stored in the body to be used as a backup source of energy.
How many macronutrients does your body need?
Your recommended macronutrient intake can vary based on your age, sex, weight, activity level, and goals. Try our Macro Calculator to get personalized recommendations.
Or, instead of setting a goal for the total grams of each macronutrient you need, aim for a macronutrient balance:
45% to 65% of daily calories from carbohydrates
20% to 35% of daily calories from fat
10% to 35% of daily calories from protein
Everyone needs to consume all three types of macronutrients to achieve optimal health. Any eating plan that drastically cuts one or more macronutrients will eventually lead to a dietary imbalance and increase the risk of health issues.
Examples of macronutrient food sources
There is a wide variety of macronutrient examples and macronutrient food sources that you can incorporate into your diet.
Choosing whole, unprocessed foods is a smart way to get macros without eating a lot of added sugar, salt, or other additives.
Carbohydrates: Carbs are the main source of energy for the body and they make up the bulk of your diet. Sources of carbohydrates include bread, rice, pasta, grains, fruits, starchy vegetables, beans, milk, and yogurt.
Fat: Fats provide a rich energy source and assist in processing the important fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. Sources of fat include nuts, seeds, oils, butter, sour cream, mayo, and cream cheese.
Protein: Protein is used to repair muscle, tissues, and organs and regulate hormones. Sources of protein include meat, poultry, fish, eggs, cheese, cottage cheese, and tofu.
Micronutrients Explained
Micronutrients are vitamins and minerals. The body can’t produce these types of nutrients, so you need to get them from dietary sources. They are just as important as macronutrients, but you need them in smaller quantities. Micronutrients have a significant impact on your health, and deficiencies can lead to malnutrition.
How do you measure micros?
Micronutrient amounts are measured in milligrams (mg), micrograms (mcg), or International Units (IU). All of these units are standardized measurements of very small qualities. You’ll see them listed on all nutritional labels. The labels also show what percentage of the recommended daily allowance of each micronutrient you’ll get from a serving of that food.
Micronutrients don’t contribute to calorie counts for foods because they aren’t energy sources. However, they are critical for functions like digestion, hormone production, and brain function.
Why do you need an adequate intake of micros?
Micronutrients are critical for a wide range of bodily functions. Not getting a perfect balance of micronutrients for a single day likely won’t cause health issues. But, over time, eating less than optimal amounts of important vitamins and minerals can increase the risk of illnesses such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes, cancer, and osteoporosis.
How many essential micronutrients should you ingest per day?
Each essential micronutrient has its own recommended daily allowance. You can find a comprehensive reference for micronutrient needs in the USDA’s Dietary Guidelines.
The best way to consume micronutrients is by eating a balanced diet. The best micro foods include fresh fruits and vegetables, lean meats, fish and poultry, and healthy fats such as olive oil and nuts. You can also get micronutrients from dietary supplements. Supplements should be used as a part of a healthy eating plan, not as a substitute for food-based micronutrients. If you take prescription medications or have underlying health conditions, talk to your doctor before adding any supplements to your routine.
Examples of micronutrients
There are four main categories of micronutrients:
Water-soluble vitamins: Water-soluble vitamins include vitamin B1, vitamin B2, vitamin B3, vitamin B5, vitamin B6, vitamin B7, vitamin B9, vitamin B12, and vitamin C. All of these vitamins dissolve in water, so your body can’t store them for later use. You need to get them from food or supplements each day. If you consume more than you need, the excess is flushed out in urine. Water-soluble vitamins strengthen cells, including red blood cells.
Fat-soluble vitamins: Fat-soluble vitamins such as vitamin K, vitamin A, vitamin D, and vitamin E dissolve in fat, not water. Once you’ve consumed them, your body can store them in fatty tissue or your liver for later use. Fat-soluble vitamins are important for eye health, immune function, and recovery from injuries.
Microminerals: Microminerals include calcium, magnesium, sodium, and potassium, which your body uses for muscle and bone health.
Trace minerals: Trace minerals include iron, manganese, copper, zinc, and selenium. They are critical for muscle health, nervous system function, and cellular repair.

HealthAndFitness,553,"Over the past few years, kimchi has become one of the trendier health foods. The traditional Korean dish made of fermented cabbage and/or radishes started popping up everywhere: on tacos, folded into fried rice, even in Bloody Marys.
People touted not only the flavor but also the health benefits. And now, there’s potentially another valid reason to eat more of it.
A new study in South Korea reported that kimchi can reduce the risk of obesity.
But before you go raiding the Asian aisle at the nearest grocery store, we talked to registered dietitian Katherine Basbaum, MS, RD, to find out whether or not the study is really accurate—and whether or not kimchi can prevent obesity.
What the study found
In the study, which was published in the medical journal BMJ Open, researchers evaluated over 115,000 Korean adults between the ages of 40 to 69. They found that of those surveyed, men who consumed one to three servings of cabbage kimchi per day had a lower risk of obesity compared to men who ate less than one serving per day.
Additionally, women in the same age group who ate one to three servings of radish kimchi per day experienced a lower risk of abdominal obesity than those who didn’t.
Benefits of kimchi
So what’s so special about kimchi? Katherine says it’s all about the lactic acid bacteria (LAB), which is a probiotic derived from the unique fermentation process.
Like many probiotics, LAB can boost your immune system, reduce inflammation, and improve your digestion. It can also potentially help prevent certain conditions, from colds and congestion to cancer and heart disease.
Katherine describes kimchi as a “flavorful, low calorie, high-fiber side dish.” However, she cautions that kimchi can be high in sodium, so be mindful of that if you’re watching your salt intake.
The final verdict
There’s no denying that kimchi can be part of a healthy diet. But as for whether or not it prevents obesity, that’s up for debate. Katherine pointed out some big flaws with this particular study.
It was funded by grants from the World Institute of Kimchi (potential bias for 500, please).
It was conducted on Korean adults, so we can’t really apply the findings to American adults as the population is completely different.
The study only shows correlation, not causation. That means that eating more kimchi may be correlated to a reduced risk of obesity but it doesn’t cause it.
So if kimchi isn’t the answer, what is?
“Though there are unfortunately no specific foods that have been proven to play a significant role in lowering obesity risk, there are most definitely dietary strategies that can help,” Katherine says. (Like tracking your food… MyFitnessPal can help with that!)

She recommends limiting “energy dense” foods, which are foods high in fat, sugar, and calories (think: anything processed). Instead, opt for “low energy dense” foods—like fruits, vegetables, and whole grains—that are high in water and/or fiber and will keep you fuller with fewer calories.
And as always, moderation is key. In the study conclusion, researchers reported that “excessive consumption suggests the potential for an increase in obesity prevalence.” Too much of a good thing isn’t always a good thing—even if you’re eating something good for you, like kimchi."
HealthAndFitness,1014,"As an NFL Strength Coach and Performance Nutritionist for some of the top names in football, Mike Minnis, MS, RD, CSCS knows a lot about using nutrition to your advantage. Here he shares a few tips on how to elevate your nutrition game like a pro athlete, so that you can crush your own health and fitness goals.
PRO TIP #1:
UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF ENERGY BALANCE
When it comes to nutrition, there are two things that are helpful to think about — what you should be eating and how much you need to eat to support the goal you’re trying to achieve.
For example, if your primary goal is to lose weight, and you’re eating healthfully (think nutritious, whole foods), but you’re consistently eating far above your daily calorie target, you will still gain weight. You need a balance.
Energy balance is highly individualized and based on a number of factors, including:
Age
Weight
Muscle Mass
Movement/Exercise
Macronutrient Composition of Diet
Regardless of your primary goal, your priority should be understanding the number of calories you need to consume on a daily basis and balancing that with nourishing foods that optimize your overall nutritional needs.
Tracking food and nutrient intake are key for many people to make progress toward their goals because it gives them a sense of their energy balance. Calorie goals like what you get in the MyFitnessPal app estimate how many calories you burn in one day, and how much to eat to reach your goal. You’ll learn how much to eat to support your goals, and how different foods affect your progress. And it’s not just all about calories, either. Certain nutrients in foods impact how much you eat overall, like protein and fiber.
PRO TIP #2:
EAT AN ADEQUATE AMOUNT OF PROTEIN AT THE RIGHT TIME
Protein is one of the most important macronutrients. In the context of athletic performance, adequate protein intake is imperative for muscle recovery and adaptation from training. It’s hard to argue against the correlation of lean body mass as it relates to strength, power, and stability in most sports—and in life in general.
The most bioavailable forms of protein (i.e. those easily absorbed and used by your body) tend to come from animal sources, such as chicken, fish, beef, pork, turkey, eggs, dairy, and whey. There are plant sources such as tofu and beans, but it may require a bit more forethought to attain your protein goals if you are vegetarian or vegan.
The most vital component of daily protein intake is the TOTAL amount you consume daily. This is more critical than any other aspects of protein intake, such as timing and dosing per meal. You should aim to consume ~0.8-1.0g/lb. of protein per day if you’re concerned with building muscle, athletic performance, and recovery from exercise.
Example: A 150 lb. athlete would need to consume 120-150g of protein per day
Once you have the total protein covered, you can move to optimal timing. Ideally, we would want our high-protein meals consumed every 4-6 hours though the day. From a per-meal amount standpoint, a good target is 0.15-0.20 g/lb./meal. This optimizes the amount of protein that goes toward building muscle rather than being used for energy.
Example: A 150 lb. athlete would need to consume ~22-30g of protein per meal throughout the day
PRO TIP #3:
GET YOUR DAILY FIBER FROM A DIVERSE RANGE OF FOODS
You’ve probably heard the terms “gut health” or “microbiome” get thrown around, especially over the last few years. The microbiome is composed of communities of bacteria that help your body break down and absorb nutrients, produce vitamins and amino acids, and prevent infection by viruses and bad bacteria.
From a nutrition standpoint, one of the best ways to enhance gut health is to consume enough diverse fibers across a range of different foods. That’s because fiber acts as “prebiotics”, feeding the good bacteria (aka “probiotics”) in your system so that they can flourish and successfully carry out their functions.
Calculating your fiber needs is relatively simple. 14g/1,000 calories consumed is a great goal. This is effective as it keeps it relative to the number of calories you are consuming in a day. So, for example, if you are consuming 3,000 calories per day, you would try to consume 42g fiber.
To do this, you would most definitely need to focus on the quality of your food in addition to the quantity by consuming whole, non-processed, high-fiber foods like the following:
Almonds
Apples
Avocado
Beans
Berries
Broccoli
Chia Seeds
Oats
Peas
Potatoes (with skin)
Whole Grains
Although this is not a cumulative list, the common denominator of all these foods is that they are considered whole foods. This is why fiber is also a great representation of diet quality. If you already try to incorporate at least one of those foods per meal, your diet quality is pretty good. If you aren’t hitting your fiber goal each day, you may want to improve the quality of your diet.
When increasing your fiber intake, start slow, by a couple grams per day, unless you want to spend all day on the toilet! Starting slow also makes it more manageable to make small changes to your diet that incorporate high-fiber foods. So, pick a food you like that’s high in fiber (you can look it up in the MyFitnessPal app) and have it as a snack or part of your meal each day.
What this looks like in the numbers game is to break your fiber goal down by meal. First, strive for at least 3g fiber per meal and see if you can hit it. Work your way up by finding more and more foods that add fiber to your diet. At minimum, try setting a baseline of 5g of fiber per meal, but aim higher than that to meet your overall goal.

HealthAndFitness,969,"Protein is a cornerstone of healthy eating and weight loss and is readily available in many of the foods you eat, including poultry, meat, dairy, fish, eggs, legumes, nuts, seeds, soy and even whole grains. Research shows higher-protein meals or snacks can also help reduce hunger and extend the feeling of satiety.
The recommended daily allowance (RDA) for men ages 19–50 is 56 grams per day, and it’s 46 grams per day for women. To get a more specific recommendation for what you need, you can calculate it based on your body weight, says Lindsey Kane, RD. “Generally speaking, you need .8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight (which is about .4 grams per pound of body weight).” This translates to about 56 grams of protein for someone who weighs 154 pounds. You can track your protein intake with an app like MyFitnessPal and also pay attention to the following signs you might not be getting enough in your diet:
1
YOU’RE LOSING MUSCLE MASS
Protein is made up of amino acids, which are essential for building muscle. This means that if you’re not getting adequate protein, your muscle mass could suffer. “You might notice this as decreased strength, change in weight or even how your clothes are fitting,” says Randy Evans, RD.
2
YOU’VE BECOME PRONE TO STRESS FRACTURES
In addition to calcium, research shows a protein-rich diet is beneficial for overall adult bone health. “Without sufficient protein to provide energy to our organs and brain, the body will look for other sources, and one place it borrows from is skeletal muscle tissue,” says Cheryl Mussatto, RD, author of “The Nourished Brain,” and “The Prediabetes Action Plan and Cookbook.” “If you are consistently running low on protein, over time, your bones will be susceptible to injuries such as stress fractures and breaks.”
3
YOU’RE ALWAYS IN A BAD MOOD
Have you snapped at your significant other or the guy at the coffee shop who wrote your name wrong? “Irritability is one of the signs of low protein,” says Jamie Hickey, a registered dietitian and personal trainer. “By mitigating the effect of carbohydrates [that can spike blood sugar], slow-digesting protein helps keep your mood stabilized.”
4
YOU’RE CONSTANTLY GETTING SICK
If you’re always under the weather, a lack of dietary protein could be to blame. “Protein is a building block of antibodies that are produced by our immune system, helping us fight off bacteria and viruses,” says Mussatto, who adds that now is a super important time to be mindful of protein consumption with cold and flu season lingering. “A diet deficient in protein also results in a reduction in T cells, which fight off germs and enhance our immune system.”
5
YOUR NAILS ARE BRITTLE AND HAIR GROWTH IS SLOW
When protein is lacking, nails can become brittle — breaking off easily — while your hair not only loses its luster, but also may stop growing, says Mussatto. Too little protein shifts the body’s focus from growing strong nails and hair to conserving protein.
6
YOU’RE NOT HEALING THE SAME
In more severe cases of protein deficiency, you may not be able to adequately repair injuries or wounds. “Many times our protein needs are increased above our baseline following certain events, including surgeries, infections or injuries,” says Melissa Macher, RD. Similar to becoming more susceptible to stress fractures, you’re also prone to slower healing. “It’s especially important to check with your doctor or dietitian after these big events to determine your specific protein needs and optimal intake.”
7
YOU’RE SNACKING MORE OFTEN
We all know what it’s like to experience a craving, but a prime sign you may be protein deficient is if you find yourself heading back to the refrigerator or pantry time and time again. “Without sufficient protein intake, you may not experience fullness,” says Emily Danckers, MS, RD. “This can lead to endless snacking trying to fill the void of hunger.”
8
YOU’RE HUNGRY AS SOON AS YOU’RE DONE EATING
It’s normal for hunger levels to fluctuate; for example, you might be hungrier after a hard workout than on a recovery day. However, if you find you can’t seem to get full or feel satisfied regularly from your meals and snacks, it might be a sign you need to incorporate more protein. “The body digests protein more slowly than carbohydrates (which give us quick energy), so it’s a good idea to include a protein source at each meal and snack for a more sustained energy level and satiety,” says Macher.
9
YOU’RE ANEMIC
Inadequate protein can slow metabolism, which affects erythropoietin (EOP) hormone production — critical to the production of red blood cells. This can result in anemia, a condition where you lack enough healthy red blood cells to carry oxygen to the body’s tissues. “Reduced dietary intake of protein may lead to mild-to-moderate anemia,” says Katherine Kimber, RD. Symptoms include fatigue, pale skin, shortness of breath (especially when exercising) and dizziness. If you’re experiencing any of these issues, it’s a good idea to speak with your doctor.
10
YOU’RE EXPERIENCING ENERGY SLUMPS
How are your daily energy levels overall? Do you find yourself having an energy slump (or two) throughout the day? “Protein slows the release of glucose [aka sugar] into the bloodstream, preventing blood sugar spikes after consuming a meal or snack,” says Katie Vaughn, MS, RD. Something as simple as pairing a piece of fruit with a handful of nuts or nut butter, or having Greek yogurt topped with fresh fruit can make a big difference, notes Vaughn.

HealthAndFitness,1105,"Given the current world climate, boosting the immune system is top-of-mind for many people. The truth is, immunity depends on many factors. Some you have control over, and others you don’t. But exercise does play a role in immunity, so it’s worth understanding how your workout efforts could be impacting your ability to fight infection. Here, experts explain when working out helps and when it hurts, plus how to safely exercise if immunity is a concern.
HOW EXERCISE HELPS YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM
“Exercise, both cardiovascular as well as resistance training, helps to strengthen the immune system and counter the effects of immunosenescence, the gradual deterioration of the immune system,” explains Tom Holland, an exercise physiologist, sports nutritionist and author of “The Micro Workout Plan.”
But how does that work, exactly? In the long-term, exercise mobilizes T cells, a type of white blood cell that helps protect the body against infection, Holland explains. “This holds true for both moderate- and high-intensity cardiovascular exercise,” he adds.
Evidence also suggests that obesity can cause immunosuppression and increased susceptibility to illness, says Aaron Brown, a certified personal trainer and research associate at Ultimate Performance. But research has shown regular bouts of exercise can help reverse some of these effects, even without weight loss. So it’s likely everyone’s immune system can benefit from some exercise, regardless of their weight.
While exercise-induced positive changes have been observed on a cellular level, there’s also strong epidemiological evidence, or evidence that’s been observed at a population level, that exercise is a good thing for our immune systems.
“As humans, our disease susceptibility follows a J-shaped curve,” explains Todd Buckingham, Ph.D., an exercise physiologist at Mary Free Bed Sports Rehabilitation Performance Lab. This means people who don’t have any physical activity (or very little) have a moderate risk of developing an upper respiratory tract infection, which is how you’d categorize COVID-19. People with moderate levels of physical activity have a low risk of developing an upper respiratory tract infection, about 40% less than those with low/no activity, Buckingham explains.
IN SOME CASES, EXERCISE MIGHT HURT
The end of the J-curve described above concerns those with “exhaustive” levels of physical activity. For those people, the risk of upper respiratory tract infection is high — about 50% greater than those with low levels of physical activity, Buckingham says. “Because COVID-19 is a respiratory disease, this is particularly important for athletes (and non-athletes) to pay attention to right now.”
Holland agrees, noting that true high-intensity and especially long-duration cardio — what marathoners and Ironman triathletes engage in while training — can have a detrimental effect on the immune system. “These athletes often have a mild cold or sore throat during their taper, and this is often attributed to the extended workouts and volume of training,” he adds.
This might be in part due to something known as the hormesis effect. “Hormesis theory suggests that there is an appropriate dose of stress our physiology actually adapts to in the mid- to long-term to protect us from future bouts of stress,” Brown explains. “Too little stress and we won’t adapt and progress from exercise; too much stress from training and we can end up not recovering, injured, in pain and even seeing our performance suffer.” So there’s a range of “just enough” exercise, and we don’t want to go too far over or under it.
There’s also some evidence that individual sessions of intense exercise suppress the immune system, Brown says. “The secretion of immune cells, known as lymphocytes, is down-regulated, and other hormones and protein messengers in our body are seemingly negatively impacted.” In the ‘80s and ‘90s, it was thought this temporary suppression of the immune system created a window of opportunity for an increase in susceptibility to illness, he says.
Newer research indicates that this may not be the case, though. Instead of the lymphocytes being downregulated, it may just be that they’ve moved locations, for example, to the lungs in anticipation and preparation to “do battle” in the face of an infection, notes Tracey Evans, PhD, a science writer and medical researcher. But this research is emerging, so it’s hard to confidently make recommendations based on it.
In any case, it’s unlikely exercising too intensely is something most people need to worry about. Even with the popularity of at-home HIIT programs, the overwhelming majority of people do not truly exercise at these higher intensities, Holland explains. “That being said, for those who do push their cardiovascular workouts into the anaerobic ‘red zone,’ it’s better to hold back for a few weeks while continuing to exercise in these unique times.”
HOW TO EXERCISE IF YOU’RE CONCERNED ABOUT IMMUNITY
IF YOU DON’T EXERCISE, NOW IS A GREAT TIME TO START
“With many state governments enacting a stay-at-home order, this gives us an opportunity to spend more time exercising,” Buckingham says. “Don’t worry that the gyms, pools and fitness centers are closed. Just take a look around you and anything can be used for exercise.”
IF YOU ALREADY EXERCISE, TAKE IT EASY
“This is the time to err on the side of caution,” Holland says. When in doubt, he advises going easier and focusing on cardiovascular endurance — but not to excess. LISS workouts are a great option, he adds.
IF YOU WERE STRENUOUSLY TRAINING, BACK OFF THE INTENSITY
Buckingham agrees, noting that if you’re a regular exerciser who pushes the limits on a daily basis, now is the time to back off your training. “With all races and events through May (and potentially further) being postponed or canceled, there is no need to be doing extremely hard training and digging your immune system into a hole right now. Continue your exercise routine, but decrease the intensity,” he advises.
THE BOTTOM LINE
“You’ll get the most benefit by exercising 3–5 days per week for 30–60 minutes per day, while keeping your heart rate less than 75% of your maximum (use 220 minus your age to approximate your maximum heart rate if you don’t know what it is),” Buckingham says. “This way, you’re doing enough to improve your immune function and decrease your risk of infection without doing too much and putting yourself at an increased risk.”
If you feel like you’re fighting something, the safest route, Evans says, is to sit out your workouts: “This would be more damaging than beneficial and can have serious consequences.”

HealthAndFitness,1143,"Whether or not you track food or count macros, it’s no secret getting adequate protein is key to satisfying meals and overall health. You’ve also likely heard it’s important to include it at every meal — skimping on protein all day long and then capping things off with a giant piece of meat for dinner isn’t going to have the same benefit as getting adequate (but not excessive) protein with every meal and snack. Sneaking extra protein into breakfast is a great way to start the day.
And, it turns out, it’s especially important to eat enough protein in the morning. “Eating a protein-packed breakfast will not only leave you feeling satisfied with the morning meal; research suggests it may also help keep hunger at bay throughout the day,“ says Marisa Moore, RDN.
So, just how much protein should you be aiming for at breakfast? “Protein needs vary by person — your height, weight, types and frequency of physical activity and health status can all affect protein needs,” says Moore. A general guideline is that healthy, sedentary adults should aim for at least 1.4g of protein per kilogram of bodyweight every day, and active individuals, pregnant or breastfeeding women and dieters likely need more. Overall, each meal should include at least 15 grams of protein and most should include 20–30 grams.
Breakfast can be the most challenging meal when it comes to sneaking in enough protein. Eggs are an easy option, but to help make sure your morning meal is packing enough protein to keep you satisfied and on track with your goals, here are eight easy ways to sneak more protein into breakfast:
Yes, smoothies are a great way to sneak veggies in before noon, but they’re also such an easy vehicle for protein. As long as you can tolerate dairy, there’s no reason not add Greek yogurt or cottage cheese to your morning blend; both thicken the smoothie and make it creamy, and the plain, unsweetened versions won’t add any unnecessary sugar.
Nonfat Greek yogurt adds a little bit of tang to fruity green smoothies, and a 6-ounce serving packs about 17 grams of protein and 100 calories. Nonfat cottage cheese makes berry-based smoothies taste like cheesecake and has about 20 grams of protein and 120 calories per 6 ounces.
“Greek yogurt and cottage cheese pack a hefty protein punch and pair well with fruit, but they also work with savory ingredients like pesto,” says Moore. A bowl of yogurt with fruit, nuts and granola is a no-brainer and a great choice. For a no-cook breakfast that’s a little more fun and unexpected, try serving leftover roasted veggies over Greek yogurt with a dollop of pesto or topping cottage cheese with chopped heirloom tomatoes, basil and a splash of balsamic vinegar.
While stovetop or microwave oats contain plenty of healthy carbs and fiber, they’re often lacking in the protein department, since they’re often made with water or a little bit of milk. Overnight oats, on the other hand, are usually made with Greek yogurt, which gives the mixture its pudding-like consistency that’s so darn satisfying.
This simple, yogurt-based overnight oat recipe packs 18 grams of protein per serving and is easy to customize by switching out different fruits, nuts, seeds and sweeteners. And, these spiced apple overnight oats have 21 grams of protein, plus healthy fats from almond butter and walnuts.
Not everyone loves the taste or the idea of protein powder, but if you’ve found one you like, it’s the perfect way to add protein to oats and smoothies without any real effort. The trick is to pair it with super flavorful ingredients, so there’s not a distinct protein powder flavor in every bite (or sip).
For anyone craving an extra dose of caffeine in their breakfast, these coffee-infused overnight oats pack an impressive 21 grams of protein, and the coffee flavor really sings. Smoothies with flavor-packed ingredients like pineapple, coconut or cocoa are great candidates for a scoop of protein powder.
If you swear by a bowl of warm oatmeal over a cute jar of overnight oats, here’s a little trick: Cook your stovetop oatmeal just as you normally would, then remove it from the heat and stir in 1/3 cup egg whites for every 1/2 cup oats. Once the egg whites are incorporated, put everything back on low heat and stir constantly (so that the eggs don’t scramble) until the mixture is thick. The egg whites add a fluffy texture but won’t change the flavor.
Here’s a banana and blueberry egg white oatmeal recipe to get you started.
Whether you’re vegan or just looking to shake up your usual breakfast rotation, scrambled tofu is an awesome egg substitute with a similar consistency. Add veggies just as you would to scrambled eggs and swap cheese for a sprinkle of nutritional yeast, which packs umami flavor and some protein for a fraction of the calories of classic egg add-ins like Parmesan or cheddar.
This golden tofu scramble gets extra flavor from turmeric and has an impressive 20 grams of protein per serving.
“Egg muffins packed with broccoli or other vegetables are a quick heat-and-eat breakfast,” says Moore. Basically mini frittatas, you can make egg muffins by mixing beaten eggs or egg whites with add-ins like veggies, cheese, cooked meat, quinoa and herbs, then pouring the mixture into a muffin tin and baking for 20 minutes at 375°F (191ºC).
Cooked egg muffins keep in your fridge for up to four days and there are so many possible flavor combinations that you’ll likely never get sick of them. The best part is they taste great reheated or cold, so you really can just grab a few and rush out the door in the morning.
Make a batch of these baked veggie egg cups during next week’s meal prep, and you won’t worry about breakfast for days.
Eggs, bacon, toast, oatmeal, yogurt bowls, pancakes, pastries and smoothies are what typically come to mind when we think of breakfast, but there’s no rule that says you have to stick to these things.
“If you’re eating in the morning, remember that it doesn’t have to be ‘breakfast food,’” says Moore. “You can eat leftover fish or chicken with vegetables for breakfast if you want!” Who’s going to stop you? The police?”
The idea of dinner leftovers, a chicken-topped salad or a turkey sandwich for breakfast might not be appetizing to everybody, but if it sounds good to you, go for it. Meat is the most obvious protein source out there, and there’s no reason it can’t have a place in your morning routine.
