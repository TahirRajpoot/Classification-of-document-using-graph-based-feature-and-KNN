ScienceAndEducation,1042,"When we head to the gym, some of us spend the majority of our time engaging in aerobic activities, and some of us spend most of our time lifting weights. Others mix and match, engaging in a series of workouts that mix cardio and lifting. This latter form of workout, known as interval training, may be a great option not only for working out but also as a parallel approach to helping students learn in the classroom.
A recent study compared the learning of students when provided with extended time in direct instruction or active learning: a block of both in which students engaged in each methodology for about nine minutes and in intervals of three-minute changes between both approaches. The three-minute intervals turned out to be the most beneficial for students in learning and applying core content. The intervals allow students to stay focused on explicit modeling while also having time to process the information with others. These two approaches appear to complement each other when placed in a brief window of time.
Interestingly, students tended to prefer the interval approach to other formats. This may be due, at least in part, to our current habits related to our attention span. Gloria Mark, a professor at the University of California, Irvine, shared that our ability to hold focused attention has dwindled from an average of 2.5 minutes to a little under 50 seconds in the past 20 years. This 47-second average is the sustained time that people can engage in a task that has some degree of challenge or difficulty.
By engaging in a mixed-methods approach, teachers can tap into students’ current levels of attention to model and enable students to process new content knowledge.
To begin an interval-style approach in the classroom, teachers need to prepare for stops within explicit instructional lessons, segues between both approaches, and strategies to maximize learning and reduce inefficiencies in transitions. Here are a few ideas to create the jolt that students need to engage fully in a classroom lesson.

2 WAYS TO BRING INTERVAL INSTRUCTION TO YOUR CLASSROOM
1. Focus on chunking. Chunking is a way in which teachers structure new content by breaking whole concepts or models into small digestible bites for students to comprehend. Teachers typically provide reading of new material, explicit modeling, frequent review, and discussions and application activities to enable students to learn new pieces of content and then organize the information into patterns and chunks. To infuse chunking into interval training, teachers may consider engaging in the following:
Break your information down into small three-minute chunks of information. The first interval should provide an overview of the lesson. The next series of intervals will break the overview into smaller chunks or parts. For instance, you may share that you are going to discuss the cardiovascular system and provide an overview of the organ system and that each chunk will be a part of the system (e.g., heart, lungs, blood).
During explicit instruction, infuse random questioning and actively involve students in the lecture through choral and echo reading to gain familiarity with the nomenclature. Random questioning typically includes cold-calling on students to address questions such as these: How are the heart and lungs alike? How are they different? What is the main idea of homeostasis? What are the strengths and weaknesses of metaphors that we use for our organs such as the heart or lungs? What are some possible solutions for the problems of the following heart conditions? What do you still not understand about blood flow?
Backward-fade procedures so that students fill the gaps of worked problems from the last step, giving them an opportunity to routinely see you complete the first, most complex, steps of a problem. In a backward fade, a teacher would model the first several steps and then leave the last step for students to complete. For instance, if you were working on a five-step problem with students, you would model steps one through four, and then they would do step five.
This process allows you to continually model the first several steps, which are typically the most complicated, and then give students the opportunity to successfully complete the last step. You repeat this process, slowly fading the scaffolding. So in the next round of the five-step process you would model steps one through three, and students would complete steps four and five.
2. Build structured conversations. Structure active learning using short and sharp practices. The following practices may be helpful.
A three-interval drill. This strategy tasks students with forming sentences using conjunctions, subordinating conjunctions, and appositives or fronted adverbials through oral communication. For instance, you may ask students to create a sentence comparing the lungs and the heart, then incorporating academic vocabulary such as oxygenated or deoxygenated blood, followed by creating three sentences that infuse because, but, and/or, so.
The two-box induction process. This method requires students to evaluate related but uniquely different ideas within two boxes. For instance, one box may illustrate organs within the cardiovascular system, while the other box shows organs within the digestive system. Students work together to create sentences showing relationships between both boxes.
A Frayer model. Using this tool allows you to infuse different levels of questions for students to complete in pairs or groups. A Frayer model has four boxes, in which each box specifies a different level of complexity. Box one requires students to answer a “what” or “how” question (e.g., What is the primary function of the heart?). Boxes two and three require students to answer a “why” question (e.g., Why does the heart appear to never rest in the human body?). Box four tasks students with answering a transfer-style question (i.e., including to what extent, should, who).
An extended three-interval drill. This allows you to have students use contrasting and comparing connectives along with summaries. For instance, once students have used a conjunction, another student follows up with a new sentence that begins with a comparing connective (e.g., In addition…) or contrasting connective (e.g., On the other hand…)."
ScienceAndEducation,1079,"No matter how hard we might try, the polarized climate outside of our classrooms still seeps into them. This climate pushes our students into us-versus-them thinking, toward less careful and open listening and a higher degree of tension and anxiety from walking around in what can be a hostile environment due to relentless bullying.
These conditions give rise to fearful exclusion of those not like ourselves and, on rare but too frequent occasions, extremes of lashing out violently or ending one’s own life in a desperate search for relief.
It’s traditional to try to address these tendencies with healthy conflict resolution, communication, and effective relationship-building skills. But Tim Shriver, cofounder of UNITE, an organization that supports national unity, believes that our attitudes and emotions direct our skills.
One of the attitudes and emotions that are far too prevalent is that of contempt. Tim Shriver has referred to contempt as a feeling of disdain and disgust for another person or group that is accompanied by an attitude of holding oneself above others and seeing others as worthless. The opposite is dignity: seeing the inherent worth in everyone. An attitude of dignity counters polarization, promotes listening, and replaces hostility with caring.
A school that allows contempt to flourish—or even simmer—is the kind of school where students (and staff) experience fear when they should be focused on learning and on supporting one another. What’s needed is a tool that can help schools move away from contempt and toward dignity by shining the healing light of conversation.

THE DIGNITY INDEX
The Dignity Index is a new measure created by UNITE in 2021 to help us better understand how we treat each other during disagreements. On this measure (ranging from 1 to 8), lower scores (1 and 2) indicate contempt and division, and higher scores (7 and 8) are indicative of someone who sees dignity in others, respects differences, and works together with others. Although this measure has not yet been brought to many schools, some have started.
Salt Lake City schools are using the Dignity Index in their classrooms. Here is an adaptation of what they have done:
8—Dignity: I treat everyone with dignity. I believe everyone is born with inherent value. Everyone is important and deserves to be treated with kindness and respect no matter who they are.
7—Connectedness: I fully engage with others. I listen and talk with people who have different ideas, even if I don’t agree with them. I’m open to admitting mistakes I’ve made, and I am open to changing my opinion.
6—Curiosity: I make an effort to talk to a variety of other people, even if I don’t agree with them on everything. I focus on our shared interests and common values.
5—Respect: I recognize that others have a right to be here and express their thoughts; even though it can be difficult, it’s their school, too. We all belong here.
4—Dismissiveness: I’m better than them. They’re different and annoying. They don’t really belong. We shouldn’t trust them.
3—Disdain: I’m doing as well as I can, while some others are responsible for so many problems here. We’re the good people, and they’re the bad people. It’s us versus them.
2—Disgust: Some people here really disgust me. Things would be better if they weren’t here. They’re going to ruin everything if we let them. It’s us or them.
1—Contempt: I hate some people in this school. They are terrible and are destroying it here. They need to go. They are not valuable humans. If we don’t hurt them first, they will hurt us.
If your classroom or school does not feel comfortable, it’s likely that your ratings would be between 1 and 4. This implies that people are not listening to or talking patiently and caringly to one another. The developers of the index make the following suggestions to move up the Dignity Index.
IMPROVING YOUR DIGNITY INDEX
Guide people to use more dignity and less contempt in what they read, what they say, what they watch, and what they support.
Encourage people to expect the use of dignity from the people who represent them, entertain them, and inform them. This is how the culture can start to change.
There are two important parts to this suggestion. First, each of us in schools—and each of our students, especially starting at the secondary level—needs to adopt attitudes toward others that are characterized by more respect, curiosity, connectedness, and dignity. Second, we need to expect that those with whom we interact—as political leaders, entertainers and sports figures, and sources of our news and information—are not exemplars of dismissiveness, disdain, disgust, or contempt for others, generally or for particular groups.
PUT THE DIGNITY INDEX TO WORK IN YOUR CLASSROOM
One activity is to take the eight words in the Salt Lake City version and present them to groups of students in mixed order and ask them to put them on a continuum, explaining the meaning of each word and why they created the order that they did. Have groups present their orders and discuss differences. You can have them create a composite version to use in your classroom/school. You also can present the Salt Lake City version and have them reflect on similarities and differences and/or use that version as a model to create a final version.
You might even want to have your class complete the Dignity Index on themselves periodically as a way to monitor the conversational climate. As you see your class’ Dignity Index head toward a 7 or 8, you can proudly say that it has become a norm for your students to respect differences and work together.
Social and emotional learning skills underlie the need to treat others with dignity, and they are activated in the process of having genuine conversation. Through conversations, we can help students build active listening skills, learn how to respectfully disagree with others, strengthen peer relationships, and support dignity. By creating our classrooms as safe, supportive spaces for critical and creative thinking and guiding students in how they talk to each other, we can improve their listening, learning, and character.
What about you? As you reflect on your classroom and/or school, how do you think the concept of dignity can be used?"
ScienceAndEducation,893,"When you think of using technology for math learning, what usually comes to mind first? For many educators, it’s programs that consist of repetition to gain mastery. This type of learning is focused on finding the solution to the problems given and does not focus on the process. But what if we could use technology in a different way? What if we could use technology to energize math learning and make it more interactive?
This is not in itself a new idea. In fact, the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) Guiding Principles state, “An excellent mathematics program integrates the use of mathematical tools and technology as essential resources to help students learn and make sense of mathematical ideas, reason mathematically, and communicate their mathematical thinking.”
In my work as an elementary school tech coach, I have explored lots of ways to amplify math learning with technology tools, such as to help students better visualize math concepts, to promote math interaction among students, and to provide multimodal ways to share students’ math thinking.
By examining technology tools in these ways, we can ensure that the tools we use with our students provide them with opportunities that they would not have otherwise. So let’s take a deeper dive into each of these features.

3 WAYS TECH TOOLS CAN AMPLIFY MATH LEARNING
1. Many tech tools offer our students the opportunity to visualize math concepts in an exciting way. As educators, we need to prioritize tools that give our students this capability. Do the tech tools you use offer virtual manipulatives? If so, consider using them for this feature. In addition, the NCTM shares the importance of using and connecting mathematical representations, and this feature speaks directly to this practice.
Desmos Classroom, a free tool through Amplify Education, gives us that opportunity. Its tools help our students to better visualize math. It has Mathigon’s Polypad, which contains a wealth of virtual math manipulatives. Included in these manipulatives are base-10 blocks, fraction circles, and more. For example, when I ask my learners to show different ways to make 10, they have many options to demonstrate this—including the use of number tiles.
Desmos Classroom also helps students to visualize math using sliders for modeling and graphs. When I introduce fractions to my second- and third-grade students, the sliders are a great way to help them first understand how to partition fractions and then to make the connections between these models and the number-line model.
2. Another essential way that we can use technology is to promote math discourse. We need to give our students opportunities to share their math thinking and learn from one another. As educators, we cannot be the only audience for our students’ thinking. We need to facilitate a culture of discourse in our classrooms. In fact, one of NCTM’s eight practices includes fostering a culture of meaningful discourse.
One of my favorite ways to do this is by using Pear Deck Learning’s Flashcard Factory. This free tool partners students up to make flash cards and can be a great way to get students talking about math. One student serves as the artist and shows how to solve the problem, while the other student is the writer and solves the problem, writes a word problem, or writes an equation. This depends on your task and is completely customizable. Plus, once all students are finished, classes can have meaningful discussions about their flash cards during the quality control phase.
Currently, my second-grade students are working on adding and subtracting two-digit numbers, and this activity works great for building this skill. I worked with their teachers to select four to six word problems, and then when they play Flashcard Factory, the artist shows how to solve the problem and the writer shares the equation. As they collaborate to create these cards, it’s pure magic.
3. A final important way to use technology during math instruction is providing our students with different ways to share their math thinking. Does the tech tool allow our students to share their thinking using video, audio, paint tools, text, and/or speech to text? These are all extremely important considerations that we need to take into account as we plan to use technology tools during math instruction. By allowing for multimodal thinking, we can elicit and use evidence of student discourse, another one of NCTM’s key teaching practices.
There are many programs that include this feature, including Microsoft Flip, Book Creator, and Wixie. Microsoft Flip is a free program but requires parental consent. Wixie is a low-cost option at $5 per year per student. Book Creator has a “freemium” model, which provides a limited number of features for free with additional features available for a fee. Premium features cost $13 per month or $130 per year. Regardless of which program you choose to use, think about what ways your students can share their thinking. Aim for more than two to three ways for them to do so. This allows all of our learners to best share their ideas.
As you can see, there are so many ways that we can energize math learning using technology."
ScienceAndEducation,1056,"High school teachers—we’ve all been here: about to be observed, driving to our buildings energized. Not only have we designed a great lesson, complete with culturally responsive teaching elements, social and emotional learning components, and differentiation. We’ve timed it just right, so that students will complete exit tickets before the bell rings. There’s no way we won’t get a distinguished rating in all domains. 
But apparently we planned and the universe laughed—because not a single student chimes in (well, except for Andre, who asked to go to the bathroom after the first 10 minutes).   
What do we do? We use the wait time drilled into us in grad school. While waiting, we glance at our Apple Watch and realize that not even a full minute has passed, but our heart rate is 127. We take a deep breath and try to control our emotions. The class is silent today except for the kid in the back rummaging through his book bag and the clacking of keys as our administrator types away. What could she be typing? No one’s saying anything!  
Desperate to get the observation over with, we use our last lifeline, pivoting and diving into teacher-centered instruction, showcasing how much we know about the American Revolution or polynomials and doing checks for understanding while we run through Google Slides—all while thinking, Why didn’t they say anything? I know my lesson wasn’t boring. I mean, I had memes on my slides and even played a YouTube clip! 
Two weeks later, after receiving a “Basic” in the Student Engagement domain, some of us blame our administrator, who expects us to be a magician; some of us chalk it up to Gen-Z not caring about anything other than TikTok; some of us spend the evening scrolling Indeed for a work-from-home gig.
Perhaps there’s another answer: A student-centered learning environment is not only what administrators want to see but is what is best for students. That’s why, way back in 2007, I created an assessment tool and discourse protocol called the Real Talk Method.

COMMON OBSTACLES TO PARTICIPATION
In 2007, when I transitioned from an adjunct professor to a high school teacher, I noticed—and continue to notice—that students’ lack of engagement is less about lack of ability or desire to participate and far more about two specific things: a lack of reward for participating and a lack of tools needed to participate. 
Here’s why: Students (who are humans first) want to feel rewarded for participating, especially if they’re not certain whether they’re right. No student (or human) wants to be wrong; it’s not in our nature. 
Many students are grappling with ways to articulate themselves because they may lack the tools needed to participate in a way that makes them feel and look “smart.” I hear it all the time when I speak with my students one-on-one: “I don’t wanna feel stupid, Miss,” and “I mean, I know it, but I’m not tryna be wrong.” 
INTRODUCING: THE REAL TALK METHOD
The name Real Talk is inspired by my Bronx upbringing, which was widely influenced by hip-hop. Where I come from, when we wish to engage in serious discussion, want to assure our audience of our honesty, are passionate about something, or just need the floor for a minute, we preface our statement with the assertion, “Real Talk!”  
The method is a riff on both Bloom’s Taxonomy and the Socratic Seminar, two staples I keep tucked in my pedagogical purse.  
My Real Talk method serves four educational purposes: It facilitates academic discourse or accountable talk by encouraging students to use higher-order thinking skills; it assesses oral participation; it does so quantitatively and qualitatively by assigning point values to students’ responses based on their level on Bloom’s Taxonomy; and it motivates students to participate by providing immediate feedback and rewards (grades). 
APPLYING REAL TALK IN PRACTICE
I begin the school year by explicitly teaching students about Bloom’s Taxonomy as a classification system for learning. To do this, I use the Pledge of Allegiance as my example, asking students these questions: Can you recite the Pledge of Allegiance? Do you understand what all the words mean? Can you apply the pledge to anything? Have you ever analyzed its meaning? Have you evaluated its value? Can you understand why some people refuse to recite it or stand for it? If you were to create your own pledge, what would you include or exclude? 
I introduce and explain the Real Talk method and rules, which make up my assessment tool that assigns points based on the Bloom level to which students’ responses or contributions correspond.
For example, a green check mark means that a student’s response to a seminar question is on the recall level, which is appropriate but low on Bloom’s, whereas a star means that a student’s response is on the understanding level or higher. The first check mark equates with 65 percent, and each additional check mark adds 5 percent. A star equates with 85 percent, two stars with 90 percent, three stars with 100 percent. After a student receives a star, each check mark equals one point. So, if a student received a check, then a star, then a check, they would have 97 percent.
The goal for each student is to get 100 percent, which is their classwork and participation grade for the seminar.  
During seminars, one student volunteer is appointed scorekeeper and keeps a running tally of students’ points on the board. That way, every student can view their progress in real time.  
DEEPENING STUDENT ENGAGEMENT
The Real Talk method brings the enthusiasm that is usually only reserved for sports into the academic space, which is rare and so very needed—because, yes, learning is supposed to spark joy, not anxiety or fear.  
Students’ excitement around this tool is what drives my own excitement, keeping me motivated to continuously develop engaging content through thought-provoking questioning and culturally relevant material.  
The Real Talk method also facilitates healthy competition and excitement about learning while cultivating higher-order thinking skills in real time, and in a real way.  
No magic needed—just good, old-fashioned realness. "
ScienceAndEducation,1151,"With reading research and methodology in the current spotlight, educators are learning more about dyslexia. Now, many are asking for the same support regarding math instruction and dyscalculia, which Dr. Honora Wall, founder of the Dyscalculia Training and Research Institute, defines as “a type of neurodivergence: a difference in brain development or function.”
There’s much less research, however, about dyscalculia than there is for dyslexia. In Dyscalculia: From Science to Education, cognitive neuropsychologist Brian Butterworth writes that since 2000, the National Institutes of Health has spent $107.2 million in funding for dyslexia research but only $2.3 million on dyscalculia. Consequently, students with dyscalculia are not getting the support they need, due to the lack of teachers’ knowledge about the disorder. 
Programs and approaches designed for the needs of learners who are dyslexic, such as Orton-Gillingham, Barton, S.P.I.R.E., and Fundations, just to name a few, are readily available. With no equivalent for dyscalculia, educators are scrambling for just the right tools to effectively address the needs of a vulnerable population. The good news is, there are several very concrete ways teachers can support these students.

WHAT DYSCALCULIA IS NOT
It’s not dyslexia with numbers. Dyslexia typically involves difficulty learning how to read, which can interfere with math learning. However, dyscalculia impedes a person’s ability to make sense of numbers and math concepts in ways that are different from dyslexia. 
It’s not uncommon. Research suggests, according to Butterworth, that dyscalculia is just as prevalent as dyslexia. In fact, Butterworth maintains that it’s estimated that 50 to 60 percent of people with dyslexia also have dyscalculia. 
It’s not being bad at math. Studies have shown that babies demonstrate an innate understanding of numerosity, as Butterworth says in his book. Dyscalculia is a learning difference that requires specialized teaching and isn’t just “being bad at math.”
INDICATORS OF DYSCALCULIA
There are several behaviors that can present themselves in learners with dyscalculia. Just as dyslexia and ADHD (attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder) present themselves on a spectrum, the same is true for dyscalculia. That means that each student brings with them a unique set of strengths and weaknesses. Below are behaviors that are typical for students with dyscalculia. 
Difficulties subitizing and estimating: Subitizing is the ability to “see” small numbers without actually counting them. For example, when rolling a die, a young student with dyscalculia will need to count the dots as opposed to automatically seeing that the number rolled was four.
Difficulties with patterns: Students with dyscalculia may have difficulty putting numbers in order from least to greatest or greatest to least. They also may struggle with skip counting or determining what number would come next in a sequence. 
Loss of previously acquired skills: Research, according to Wall, hasn’t quite determined why this happens, but it is very typical for students with dyscalculia to forget the math they learned, much to the dismay of their teachers. Some lose information quickly, others over time. This is why reference charts and a structured, spiraling curriculum are crucial. 
WHAT KIND OF TEACHING DO DYSCALCULIC LEARNERS NEED? 
CRA Instructional Sequence: In The Dyscalculia Toolkit: Supporting Learning Difficulties in Maths, specialist teacher Ronit Bird agrees with Butterworth that a Concrete Representational Abstract instructional sequence is an approach that moves students from using concrete manipulatives to representational drawings to abstract numbers when learning new concepts and is a best practice for all learners. Dyscalculic learners will need to experience this sequence multiple times and gradually, when developing new skills and understandings. 
Visualization: Often the transition from the concrete stage to abstract is a bumpy one. Bird suggests that dyscalculic learners be explicitly taught how to picture numbers and operations in their mind’s eye. This is especially true when solving word problems. Drawings, open number lines, and area models are some of the ways she suggests to bridge the concrete and abstract stages. 
Quality over quantity: Bird and Butterworth both recommend limiting the demands on a learner’s working memory, allowing them to focus on the important skills of a task. Providing reference charts, reading directions, and using rubrics are just some of the ways to reduce the load placed on working memory. 
Explicit scaffolding: All learners must have a secure understanding of foundational concepts before building on them. This is especially true for learners with dyscalculia. Making explicit connections to previously taught skills and breaking tasks down into the smallest of steps are essential. This reduces the risk of taking students’ background knowledge for granted.
HOW TO PLAN INSTRUCTION
Focus on sets: Butterworth asserts that dyscalculics struggle with operations because of a deficit in the understanding of numbers as sets. Instruction needs to focus on supporting concepts such as counting, one-to-one correspondence, part-whole relationships, and cardinality in the early years. 
Diagnostics: There are assessments typically used by psychologists to diagnose dyscalculia, including the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, KeyMath-3, Wechsler Individual Achievement Test for Math Fluency, and the Feifer Assessment of Mathematics. Educators, however, must first identify which students need additional support and then specifically which mathematical knowledge is in need of intervention. Acadience Math, the Early Childhood Assessment in Mathematics, Universal Screeners for Number Sense, and the Georgia Numeracy Project are widely used resources. 
Feedback: Because a loss of previously acquired skills is a hallmark of the disability, committing mathematical understanding to long-term memory is an arduous process. It is imperative that the information learned be accurate. Wall writes that research suggests that when the brain learns new information, it does not “overwrite” what it has already learned, even if that information is incorrect.
This speaks to the uphill battle that teachers face when having to undo a misconception that a student has committed to memory. In order to avoid this, students who struggle must be given consistent, real-time feedback as they learn. In addition to teacher input, Butterworth recommends adaptive digital platforms and games as great ways to provide feedback consistently.
Manipulatives: Numbers are abstract. Manipulatives make numbers concrete. Using blocks, Cuisenaire rods, ten frames, and counters are just some of the ways students can have hands-on experiences. Dyscalculic learners solidify the concept that numbers are made up of sets of smaller numbers with tactile input from manipulatives.
Joy: Fear of math is a reality for many and is a major obstacle to learning. Years of struggle reinforce math as unenjoyable and a source of anxiety. The frequent use of games modified to students’ current levels of understanding can have a disarming effect on those who experience math aversion. 
There is still much to learn about dyscalculia. When armed with the right information, however, educators can make small changes to their practice that will have a huge impact on the lives of those with dyscalculia. "
ScienceAndEducation,1031,"In the rapidly evolving landscape of education, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) has become increasingly prominent in discussions about how it may shape the future of learning. In fact, I can’t think of a single conversation I’ve had recently where AI has not been a talking point. While many classrooms, schools, and districts may be eager to harness the potential benefits of AI, there exists a significant segment of folks who remain hesitant or reluctant to explore this technology and have valid concerns. Understanding and addressing the concerns of reluctant adopters is crucial to understanding AI adoption and how it can be used in various roles, as well as how you as a school leader can support them as they explore this technology.
UNDERSTANDING RELUCTANCE TOWARD AI ADOPTION
I work with educators who are in various stages of AI exploration. Some have gone headfirst into exploring different platforms and strategies, others have very limited understanding of AI, and others don’t want to work with it at all until more clear guardrails and guidelines come out from their workplaces. Regardless of where anyone is in their journey to understanding this tool, there are some legitimate challenges with implementing artificial intelligence in the classroom, and these are often voiced by both early and new adopters.
For example, when I speak with educators and school leaders, there are many questions about the role of AI in the classroom and in the school—particularly data privacy permissions; collection of student data; and the ethics of using AI for activities, research, and assignments. 
Some educators also may not have adequate training or experience with AI technology, which causes uncertainty about effective integration into their teaching practices. Additionally, some educators may simply think that AI isn’t appropriate for their students, especially when it comes to critical skills such as writing, reading comprehension, and planning. This is especially true for pre-K through fifth grade, where these foundational skills are being built up. 
As with any technology tool or resource, there needs to be proper planning and implementation of a given AI tool in order for an educator to consider the lesson or activity to be a success. With so many new AI tools and technologies coming out, it may be confusing for some educators to decide which ones may be helpful for them. Confusion can sometimes lead to hesitation when it comes to implementation.
I think the best way to address these concerns is to find solutions that not only honor educators’ concerns, but also help them discover ways that AI may enhance their work. This isn’t to say that all educators will gravitate toward using AI, but it’s important to support them in their journey—regardless of what stage they’re in.

HOW TO ENCOURAGE AND SUPPORT AI ADOPTION
Try out these approaches on your campus, whether you’re at an elementary, middle, or high school.
1. Consider creating an AI awareness campaign. It’s important for faculty and staff to know the available and vetted AI resources allowed within their roles. Depending on whether your school or district has guidelines (or if your state has guidelines), make sure that faculty and staff know what’s available to them and how they can use AI.
If you’re in a school, district, or state that doesn’t have guidelines yet, consider referencing areas that have already created guidelines as a blueprint. And if you’re in a school, district, or state that’s discouraging AI, try to become involved in discussions around AI usage and guidelines in your area.
2. Whenever possible, provide accessible, engaging resources to demystify AI. In the United States, I point people to the Office of Educational Technology’s guidelines for AI implementation as a good first step—they’ve got fantastic resources surrounding AI implementation and current best practices. However, remember to also do your own research to determine the resources that best support your faculty and staff. I look for resources that highlight the capabilities of AI in education, as well as give a brief history of AI that helps faculty and staff understand that AI has actually been around since 1956 (1957 is when the phrase artificial intelligence was coined). Foundational resources will help people identify ways that they could potentially use AI in their roles.
3. Offer professional development programs to upskill employees in AI technologies. You can also share quick tips in faculty newsletters and PLC meetings. If you are a teacher interested in AI technologies, reach out to professional associations, educational conferences, or local educational institutions to inquire about potential training opportunities on AI. If you are a school leader, try to attend conferences, workshops, or seminars that focus on AI, and network with colleagues to gather information about relevant training programs. Several apply to K–12. Some programs are online, such as Coursera and EdX, while others may be in person. You can also seek recommendations from colleagues or professional networks—sometimes we receive great recommendations from others.
4. Implement pilot projects to demonstrate the tangible benefits of AI for educators and students. If you have a group of educators from a particular grade level or a classroom educator who is interested in using AI in the classroom, consider implementing an AI pilot project. Choose a specific use case or problem that AI can help address within the school environment, such as suggesting personalized learning recommendations for students (speech-to-text features and live captions during learning) or automating administrative tasks for teachers (streamlining lesson planning outlines or creating professional learning community agendas).
5. Showcase success stories from early adopters within the school. Last but certainly not least, when something impactful or innovative is done by using AI, be sure to celebrate it! Be sure to recognize faculty and staff who are doing innovative things with technology in the classroom and beyond (during meetings and curriculum events). Even a simple shout-out or recognition in a newsletter can go a long way and spark conversation among colleagues about what they’re doing in their own work."
ScienceAndEducation,1216,"Too often, we ask students to demonstrate their learning through tests, essays, and lab reports that are only ever seen by themselves and the teacher before being stuffed into backpacks and forgotten. For some students, the desire to learn or the pursuit of a grade is motivation enough to perform well on these assessments. However, for many more, knowing their final projects will be displayed, presented, or performed for a public audience is the difference between students doing just enough to get it done and pushing themselves to, in the words of renowned teacher Ron Berger, produce “beautiful work” that genuinely reflects their learning.
PLAYING A GAME
Sixty students from several Bay Area schools filter into the Block Community Hub in downtown Oakland, California, to participate in a Facing History and Ourselves Student Leadership Group meeting, where they’ll work together to hone their leadership skills and strategize about how to better their communities.
They break into groups of four, finding seats at small tables. A board game designed to break the ice is placed in the center of each table. 
These centerpieces aren’t traditional board games. They have instructions handwritten in Sharpies, cards cut in random shapes, and game pieces sculpted from art supplies excavated from classroom cupboards. The dozen games these young leaders will play are the final product of my colleague Ashley West’s economics and inequality unit in her 12th-grade government/economics course at ARISE High School. The Student Leadership Group gathering provided a second opportunity for this project-based learning (PBL) student product to come to life.
The final project, “Playing the Economy: A Board Game Project,” asked students to define a problem in the U.S. economy, research relevant data, and create a prototype of a game that comments on the issues revealed in the data. Every lesson leading up to this project was tracked in a “Board Game Preparation” document in which students would create game pieces that either progressed or impaired players of a game based on what they learned. After about two weeks of lessons alongside the board game prep, students had two days to curate independent research relevant to the topic of their game.
In groups of three to four students, they were asked to incorporate at least 16 pieces of research in the form of questions or actions in the game. Once the research was crafted to fit into the games, the design and prototype process began. After testing and revising their prototypes, students crafted a playable board with a purpose and rule book. Ready to play, students unveiled their games to be played with families, peers, and community members at a schoolwide exhibition. 
Students were tasked not only with uncovering the systemic advantages and subsequent disadvantages of our economy but also with extending this knowledge to others in a fun and functional way. As the date of the exhibition neared, students were buzzing to finalize the research in their game pieces and conducting countless play tests for playability feedback. In the “Board Game Room” at exhibition night, players were faced with economic challenges and could either overcome barriers created by the system or play the system as it was. The experience of playing these games with family and community members quickly revealed documented disparities of wealth, difficulties of access and opportunity, and the failures of economic policy to protect all people. Students created fun ways to engage others around the serious issues of economic dysfunction. 
The project was designed to foster student creativity while also building opportunities for meaningful research. It was an exploration of design thinking, where students had to reconcile ideation and usability. Ultimately, it was an exercise in authentically communicating a need for economic and social change to their community. Creative and authentic experiences inspire the association between learning and creation, action and transformation.

PRODUCING AN AUTHENTIC PUBLIC PRODUCT
One key project-based learning design principle is student assessment through an authentic public product. This can take many shapes—a performance of monologues written from oral history interviews, a presentation of research findings to local officials, or a photography display at a museum. When designing for authenticity, an important question to consider is this: Does the product have genuine value and purpose beyond the walls of the classroom? 
When students know their projects are going to be viewed, read, heard, or even played by their families, peers, local officials, or other community members, it catalyzes motivation to do their best. Evidence of this motivation can be seen in the intricate Black History Month door designs around ARISE High School.
My colleague Ben Rosen and I led with the lens of authenticity when redesigning a prior project into the Black History Month Public Art project for our 11th-grade humanities course. Coinciding with Black History Month, the school had been engaged in an “advisory based” door-decorating contest. While some advisories were ready to jump in with ideas, the 11th-grade team noticed an overall lack of depth in the understanding/interest of our students in uplifting diverse Black voices from the past and present (many students named figures like Martin Luther King, Jr., or particular police shootings but didn’t have additional ideas). 
As a response to this, we shifted the previous year’s final product—a graphic art-based showcase of an event in history—into a research-based artistic design to compete for their advisory’s door-decorating contest. 
As the culminating assessment for their “African American History from 1619 to Reconstruction” unit, students were asked to research a historical and related present-day figure, movement, or event that showcased a form of resistance or agency. They then turned their research into the door-decoration design that they would propose in advisory the following week. Students linked figures such as Frederick Douglass to Cornel West, Harriet Tubman to “Border Angels” leaving water for migrants, and Phyllis Wheatley to Amanda Gorman. Each advisory class then voted, through a gallery walk process using stickers to identify their top choices, on the design they felt best answered the essential questions and captured the spirit of Black History Month. 
As a result of the project being engaged around a schoolwide competition, turn-in rates were higher than normal, and students felt a greater degree of seriousness and pride in their work, as it was potentially going to be displayed to their peers. 
MAKING PBL MEANINGFUL
Two excellent tools I have found valuable in the design process are the PBL Design Kit, created by the High Tech High Graduate School, and the Gold Standard Essential Project Design Elements, produced by PBLWorks.
Perhaps the most important question our students ask (you know they’re going to ask it) is “Why are we learning this?” Designing with an authentic public product in mind asks educators to have a real answer to this question before we engage our students in the rigors of learning. It intends nothing less than to shift students’ relationship to their learning as they find purpose and meaning in their work.
A sincere thanks to my colleagues Ashley West and Ben Rosen at ARISE High School for their contributions to this article."
ScienceAndEducation,834,"At the heart of every successful school are collaborative teams. However, when members of these teams display emotional intelligence (EQ) through an increased awareness of their emotions and the emotions or feelings of others, the groups are more productive. They allow educators to navigate their findings, their emotions, and their professional relationships so as to not hinder the work that needs to be done for the students. It creates a united vision and mission with an increased positive effect on school culture and community. Its impact drives positive student learning outcomes and increased parental and staff awareness on the components that drive and impact the entire school community.
In essence, collaborative teams with an increased amount of EQ create professional growth and productivity. Within education, emotional intelligence is embedded with social and emotional learning under the CASEL (Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning) framework, which breaks it into five competencies:
Self-awareness
Self-management
Social awareness
Relationship skills
Decision-making
A report on teacher preparation and SEL found that “[t]eachers’ own SEL competence and well-being plays a critical role in influencing the infusion of SEL into classrooms and schools.”
With this being said, it’s very important to have EQ embedded in multiple aspects of a school community for individual and team growth. There should be a strong focus on collaboration and reflection for both productivity and managing emotions to ensure that the work gets done effectively. The following are some strategies to utilize in order to increase the emotional intelligence among staff members within teams.

5 WAYS TO BOOST YOUR STAFF’S EQ
1. Hold literature circles. Emotional intelligence is something that typically isn’t directly addressed in teacher preparation programs. However, developing strong EQ skills improves not only your professional practices but your interpersonal relationships as well.
EQ at the workplace can drive strong collaborative teams to build the best student learning outcomes. Make time for teachers to examine their own emotional skills, build on the strength of others, and develop ways to grow as a team to collaborate through an EQ lens. These meetings can be literature circles centered around reflection and discussion. Having educators do this under a protocol will be the best way to eliminate off-topic conversations or responses based solely on strong feelings in the moment.
2. Conduct small group coaching on active listening. Active listening is a very important component of building relationships among all stakeholders within a community. Coaching small groups allows for intimate relationships to be formed among teammates. It’s a great way to have members practice in a small group setting while developing community norms to build trust and transparency.
3. Use conversation protocols. Protocols such as glow and grow and 3, 2, 1 are a great way to help guide conversations. They allow time for introverts to process and communicate while having extroverts monitor how much talk time they have and practice letting others take the floor. Protocols can help teammates build permanent practice on how meetings and conversations are held, driving productivity.
4. Hold reflective discussions about individual and team practices. Reflection is one of the most powerful characteristics addressed within the CASEL framework. It allows for self-reflection and reflecting on the emotions and feelings of others in relation to your actions and feelings. Reflective conversations allow team members to discuss their strengths and areas of growth. It allows for all to take accountability and ownership in their part to play in the development of the team and productivity.
5. Conduct surveys about thoughts on EQ and the best way to receive feedback and communicate frustrations. Developing one’s emotional intelligence can take time. Having an entire school community take part in this deeply personal work can invoke plenty of strong feelings. Therefore, it’s extremely important to consider the different behavior styles of staff members. Not all members will be direct in communication. That's why surveys that are administered and designed by community members are so important. This process allows staff to receive feedback and communicate their frustrations. It also allows movement and consideration on behalf of all stakeholders.
Emotional intelligence within schools is at the heart of the interconnectedness of the heart and mind. As educational therapist Anna T. McDonald says, “Having a high EQ enables us to handle the challenges we might encounter. In times of crisis, having this type of intelligence allows us to think rationally and temper our emotions with patience and understanding. We think before we act, practice good decision-making, and foster positive interpersonal relationships.” All of these practices are at the core of why we educate children, so they too may become resilient, empathetic, and emotionally aware citizens of their communities, building relationships and productivity no matter the task or role they play in society."
ScienceAndEducation,1689,"Not every learning myth requires teachers to pull up stakes and start all over again—at least not entirely. There are some commonly held misconceptions that contain a nugget of wisdom but need to be tweaked in order to align with the science of learning.
Sometimes, in other words, you’re already halfway there. Here are five mostly myths, from the power of doodling to the motivating role of grades, that educators can quickly adjust and turn to their advantage.
1. DOODLING IMPROVES FOCUS AND LEARNING
When we write about the power of drawing to learn, we often hear from readers who feel compelled to defend an old habit: “See, I told you that when I was doodling, I was still paying attention!” But doodling—which is commonly defined as “an aimless or casual scribble or sketch” and often consists of marginalia like cartoon characters, geometric patterns, or pastoral scenes—is distinct from what researchers call “task-related drawing.” And doodling, in this sense, is not associated with improvements in focus or academic outcomes.

In fact, both cognitive load theory and experimental studies are generally downbeat on doodling. Students who sketch complicated scenes or designs as they try to process a lesson on plate tectonics, according to the first theory, are engaging in competitive cognitive tasks and will generally underperform on both. Doodling, like all drawing, is cognitively intensive, involving complex feedback loops between visual, sensorimotor, attentional, and planning regions of the brain and body. Because our ability to process information is finite, drawing and learning about different things at the same time is a simple question of too much.
Research confirms the theory. A 2019 study pitted off-task doodling against typical learning activities like “task-related drawing” and writing. In three separate but related experiments, task-related drawing and writing beat out doodling in terms of recall—by margins as large as 300 percent.

How to fix it: Sketching what you are actually learning—from representational drawings of cells or tectonic boundaries to the creation of concept maps and organizational drawings—is, in fact, a powerful learning strategy (see research here, here, and here), and that applies “regardless of one’s artistic talent,” a 2018 study confirms.

Try to harness a student’s passion for doodling by allowing them to submit academic sketches as work products. To get even more bang for your buck, ask them to annotate their drawings, or talk you through them—which will encode learning even more deeply, according to research.
2. READING ALOUD IN TURN IMPROVES FLUENCY
Often called round robin reading (RRR), I resorted to it when I taught years ago—and it appears that it’s still frequently used, judging from a 2019 blog by literacy expert Timothy Shanahan and comments on a 2022 Cult of Pedagogy post on the topic.

Teachers deploy RRR—during which the whole class follows a text while students read sections consecutively—for good reasons: Arguably, the practice encourages student engagement, gives teachers the opportunity to gauge oral reading fluency, and has a built-in classroom management benefit as well. Students are generally silent and (superficially) attentive when a peer is reading.
But according to Shanahan, and the literacy professors Katherine Hilden and Jennifer Jones, the practice has long been frowned upon. In an influential 2012 review of relevant literature, Hilden and Jones cut straight to the point: “We know of no research evidence that supports the claim that RRR actually contributes to students becoming better readers, either in terms of their fluency or comprehension.”
In fact, RRR has plenty of problems. Individual students using RRR may accumulate less than three hours of oral reading time over the course of a year, according to Shanahan—and Hilden and Jones say that students who are following along during the activity tend to “subvocalize” as they track the reader, reducing their own internal reading speed unnecessarily. RRR also has the unfortunate effects of stigmatizing struggling readers, exposing new readers to dysfluent modeling, and failing to incorporate meaningful comprehension strategies. 
How to fix it: Yes, reading out loud is necessary to teach fluency, according to Shanahan, but there are better methods. Pairing kids together to “read sections of the text aloud to each other (partner reading) and then discuss and answer your questions” is a good approach, he says, especially if teachers circulate to listen for problems. 
More generally, reading strategies that model proper reading speed, pronunciation, and affect—while providing time for vocabulary review, repeated exposure to the text, and opportunities to summarize and discuss—can improve both fluency and comprehension.
A 2011 study, for example, demonstrated that combining choral reading—teachers and students read a text in unison (similar to echo reading)—with other activities like vocabulary review, teacher modeling, and follow-up discussion improved students’ decoding and fluency.
3. TALENT BEATS PERSISTENCE
It’s a common trap: Observers tend to rate people who appear to be naturally gifted at something more highly than those who admit they’ve worked hard to achieve success. Researchers call this the “naturalness bias,” and it shows up everywhere, from teachers evaluating students to bosses evaluating employees.
In reality, the opposite is more often true. “Popular lore tells us that genius is born, not made,” writes psychologist and widely cited researcher of human potential K. Anders Ericsson for the Harvard Business Review. “Scientific research, on the other hand, reveals that true expertise is mainly the product of years of intense practice and dedicated coaching.”
Experimental studies extend the point to academics: An influential 2019 study led by psychologists Brian Galla and Angela Duckworth, for example, found that high school GPA is a better predictor than the SAT of how likely students are to complete college on time. That’s because “grades are a very good index of your self-regulation—your ability to stick with things, your ability to regulate your impulses, your ability to delay gratification and work hard instead of goofing off,” said Duckworth in a 2020 interview with Edutopia.
How to fix it: All kids—even the ones who already excel in a discipline—benefit when teachers emphasize the importance of effort, perseverance, and growth. Consider praising students for their improvement instead of their raw scores; have students read about and then discuss the idea of neural plasticity; and consider assigning reports on the mistakes and growing pains of accomplished writers, scientists, and artists.
Try to incorporate rough-draft thinking in class, and think about taking risks yourself: The renowned writing teacher Kelly Gallagher, author of Readicide, regularly composes in front of his class to model his own tolerance for errors and redrafting.
4. BACKGROUND MUSIC (ALWAYS) UNDERMINES LEARNING
It’s a fascinating and complex question: Can students successfully learn while background music is playing?
In some cases, it appears, background music can be a neutral to positive influence; in other scenarios, it’s clearly distracting. There are several factors at play in determining the outcomes.
A 2021 study clarifies that because music and language use some of the same neural circuitry—a finding that appears as early as infancy—“listening to lyrics of a familiar language may rely on the same cognitive resources as vocabulary learning,” and that can “lead to an overload of processing capacity and thus to an interference effect.” Other features of the music probably matter, too: Dramatic changes in a song’s rhythm, for example, or transitions from one song to the next often force the learning brain to reckon with irrelevant information. A 2018 research review confirms the general finding: Across 65 studies, background music consistently had a “small but reliably detrimental effect” on reading comprehension.
In some cases, however, music may aid learning. Neuroscience suggests that catchy melodies, for example, can boost a student’s mood—which might lead to significant positive effects on learning when motivation and concentration are paramount, a 2023 study found.
How to fix it: Basically, “music has two effects simultaneously that conflict with one another,” cognitive psychologist Daniel Willingham told Edutopia in 2023—one distracting and the other arousing.
“If you’re doing work that’s not very demanding, having music on is probably fine”—and likely to motivate students to keep going, Willingham says. In those cases, try to stick to music that’s instrumental or familiar, in order to decrease the cognitive resources needed to process it. “But if you’re doing work that’s just somewhat difficult, the distraction is probably going to make music a negative overall,” Willingham adds.
5. GRADES ARE MOTIVATING
Teachers are well aware that grading, as a system, has many flaws—but at least grades motivate students to try their hardest, right? Unfortunately, the research suggests that that’s largely not the case.
“Despite the conventional wisdom in education, grades don’t motivate students to do their best work, nor do they lead to better learning or performance,” write motivation researcher Chris Hulleman and science teacher Ian Kelleher in an article for Edutopia. A 2019 research review, meanwhile, revealed that when confronted by grades, written feedback, or nothing at all—students preferred the latter two to grades, suggesting that A–F rankings might actually have a net negative impact on motivation.
In another blow to grades, a 2018 analysis of university policies like pass/fail grading or narrative evaluations concluded that “grades enhanced anxiety and avoidance of challenging courses” but didn’t improve student motivation. Providing students with specific, actionable feedback, on the other hand, “promot[ed] trust between instructors and students,” leading to greater academic ambition.
How to fix it: While grades are still mandatory in most schools—and some form of rigorous assessment remains an imperative—educators might consider ways to de-emphasize them.
Some teachers choose to drop every student’s lowest grade, for example; allow students to retake a limited number of assessments each unit; or periodically give students the discretion to turn in “their best work” from a series of related assignments. 
At King Middle School, in Portland, Maine, educators delay their release of grades until the end of the unit, an approach backed by a 2021 study that found that delayed grading—handing back personalized feedback days before releasing number or letter grades—can boost student performance on future assignments by two-thirds of a letter grade."
ScienceAndEducation,1803,"“In a fit of anger, Moses smashed the tablet against the ground.”
A group of young students reading that sentence will come to different conclusions. Depending on how familiar they are with the Bible, some may recognize it as a parable. Others may reel at the thought of an expensive electronic device being destroyed in a fit of pique. For linguistics and literacy researchers Carsten Elbro and Ida Buch-Iversen, coauthors of a landmark 2013 study on background knowledge, the difference between the two interpretations has little to do with a student’s reading comprehension skills. 
Students who properly decode the words and understand the basic structure of a text may still come up short in measures of comprehension because they fail “to activate relevant, existing background knowledge,” Elbro and Buch-Iversen explain in the study. That’s because students constantly make inferences and seek connections to their lives to make sense of what they’re reading—understanding what Moses was actually doing depends more on whether you were raised as a Christian than on your ability to grasp the sentence’s literal meaning.

In their study, Elbro and Buch-Iversen separated 236 sixth-grade students into two groups. One group of students used concept maps to connect related ideas—an exercise that helped them build a lattice of intertwined knowledge across subjects like biology, technology, sociology, and history. The second group participated in business-as-usual instruction centered around reading strategies such as summarizing and making predictions. After eight 30-minute sessions, the background knowledge students scored twice as high on tests of general reading comprehension, compared with their peers, with sizable improvements across fiction and nonfiction texts.
A decade later, new research—this time encompassing more than 10 times the number of students—confirms those findings. A groundbreaking Harvard study published last year investigated the benefits of a 10-week, knowledge-rich approach to building reading comprehension in elementary students. Instead of emphasizing traditional skills like identifying the main idea or citing evidence from the text, the researchers asked the youngsters to read widely on a topic in order to develop “generalized schemas that can be accessed and deployed when new, but related, topics are encountered.” Students read about dinosaurs, for example, and thus build a deeper understanding of how scientists collect data to study past events. Those students scored 18 percent higher on later, science-related reading comprehension tests, compared with their peers.
Here are six prereading activities to help students build background knowledge and fill in conceptual gaps before tackling new texts.
1. Sustained inquiry. “When I started looking into what’s called the achievement gap in education, I was told that the problem was high school,” Natalie Wexler, author of The Knowledge Gap, told Edutopia in 2022. “But the problems that become really obvious in high school, for the most part, have their roots in the way we teach elementary school.” In successful elementary schools, Wexler noticed that English language arts (ELA) lessons often looked like they belonged in science classrooms—in one example, fourth graders studied detailed anatomical diagrams in ELA and learned words like cardio and circulatory. By committing content knowledge to long-term memory, these students were able to continue exploring the topics while devoting more working memory to comprehension, Wexler discovered.
Wexler’s observations align with what experts recommend: a sustained, thoughtfully sequenced, content-oriented approach to building strong reading skills. When planning for the academic year, “consider the topics to be covered for the year and then ask yourself, ‘How can we integrate instruction around a coherent schema?’” suggest James Kim and Mary Burkhauser, who led the Harvard study on background knowledge. Instead of covering one topic and then moving on to something unrelated, look for ways to tie broader themes together, and revisit and reinforce them often: “Consider larger schema (the trees) that connect the topics (branches) you are expected to cover.”
If students are going to read about Roman emperors, for example, you can prepare them by exploring and reading widely across related, universal themes like civilization-building, governance, and codes of law, helping to build a rich foundation of vocabulary and thematic knowledge that students can access as they read future texts that touch upon the same concepts.
2. Vocabulary games. In a 2019 study, students who were familiar with less than 59 percent of core terms in a topic struggled to understand the reading material. But quickly memorizing new terms in isolation won’t result in lasting recall. 
Consider spending more time on vocabulary acquisition, be multimodal, and make connections to other learning, writes Rebecca Alber, an instructor at UCLA’s Teacher Education Program. She recommends using photos to introduce new words to kids or connecting the words to things they’re familiar with, are interested in, or have learned before. Students can also draw the words or work in small groups to talk about them. The dictionaries shouldn’t come out until students have worked hard to discover the definitions on their own, Alber suggests. As the list of foundational vocabulary grows over the course of the year, try word sorts—grouping words with related meaning together—or pick five terms from the course and ask students to chat quickly about how they are interrelated before they each write a quick paragraph linking the terms.
Instructional coach Hannah Bradley builds engagement by playing word games—an approach that works across subjects and age groups. “In my experience, the lighthearted nature of these games provides students with a fun, safe, and low-stakes environment where they feel more confident to just have a go,” she writes. A great starter activity is From A to Z, a five-to-eight-minute game in which students work in small groups to brainstorm words related to a topic being studied for every letter of the alphabet. Word-association games like Just One or Telephone Pictionary can help students see how concepts are interrelated, building a more robust network of interrelated ideas.
3. Station rotation. Before jumping into a new lesson, you can set up several tables with related reading materials—comics, photo collections, poetry, introductory videos, or news articles, for example—to give students multiple entry points while building familiarity with key events and people, says high school social studies teacher Tim Smyth. When Smyth starts a unit on World War II, he sets up seven tables, each with a central theme—Holocaust, leading women, and key battles, for example—which students dig into while taking notes. They also answer reflection questions such as, “Describe one image you saw that jumped out at you. Why did you choose this one?” or “What are three questions you have/want to know more about?”
“As we delved more deeply into World War II content in the weeks following book study, students made powerful connections between new content and the texts they explored at the start of the unit,” writes Smyth. “And they were better able to retain the information and see the bigger picture by referring back to the texts they explored.”
For topics that students learn at a younger age, you can use materials they’re already familiar with—using clippings from National Geographic to explore different ecosystems, for example, or short YouTube videos that delve into an interesting topic like how cavities form or what germs are—to build engagement and introduce complex ideas. Graphic novels can be used to introduce challenging concepts, says middle and high school teacher Jason DeHart, while excerpts from your students’ favorite sci-fi or historical fiction novels can be entry points to reading more complex texts. By starting with materials that students are already familiar with, you’re helping students make connections to new ideas that may otherwise be elusive.
4. Hexagonal thinking. An engaging pre-lesson activity that doubles as a way to refresh what students have learned and help them make new connections, hexagonal thinking uses cut-out hexagons—each covering a single term or concept—to explore novel insights. Working in small groups, students first create or are given a list of key ideas, which are then written on separate hexagons made digitally or from paper, card stock, or sticky notes. Students then connect the hexagons, linking related ideas together. For example, if students are learning about animal habitats, they can arrange animals by biome (forest, plains, desert) and investigate similarities and differences. Each group may have a completely different configuration of hexagons, providing fodder for a creative discussion.

5. Tools to map the conceptual terrain. If you’ve ever jumped into a book (or television) series midway, you know that it can be disorienting. That’s because a good story relies on familiarity with past events to keep the audience from getting bogged down. Similarly, students with ample prior knowledge are more likely to keep pace with a lesson.
When starting a new lesson, students unfamiliar with the topic are often overwhelmed by the amount of new information they need to process. Using graphic organizers—anchor charts and concept maps, for example—can help them map the conceptual terrain, bringing into sharp focus the difference between main ideas and support details, or how big concepts relate to each other. In a 2021 study, middle school students who used graphic organizers to organize their thinking around the topic they were learning about—the seasons—improved their factual recall by 45 percent and comprehension by 64 percent, compared with students who had simply studied the material.
For fictional texts, K–8 special education teacher Dianne Stratford recommends using story maps—an activity that helps young readers “understand the elements of a story, such as characters, setting, problem, and solution, or sequential points of the story, such as beginning, middle, and end.” Not only will it help students remember the story, but it’ll help provide a framework for understanding any future texts they encounter.
6. Pretending to learn. In Oscar Carillo’s kindergarten class, students learn about the different parts of a car—the pedals and wheels, for example—while dashing around the room making “Vroom, vroom!” sounds. In another story, they pretend to be sharks and turtles swimming through water. Not only does it strengthen oral language skills, says Principal Sarah Bartels Marrero, but also it helps them “understand the shape of a story.” 
Asking young learners to imagine story events and engage in pretend play as a prereading activity helps them build “world knowledge,” according to a 2018 study. When preschoolers spent 10 minutes pretending that they were chefs in a restaurant cooking pizza—rolling the dough, adding toppings, and then baking the pizza, for example—they predictably outperformed their peers (who had played with unrelated toys) on tests on pizza-making knowledge. The pretend-play kids were also able to make better inferences—reading between the lines to answer questions around a character’s goal or motivations, for example—outperforming their peers by more than double."
ScienceAndEducation,1531,"In the last few minutes of class, students’ minds are often focused on what awaits outside the classroom door—lunch, a pop quiz, a group presentation, unfinished homework, a chat with friends. 
But when students “abruptly go onto the next class” without a moment to make sense of what they just learned, we miss a valuable opportunity to reinforce newly acquired learning, says Sarrah Saasa, an economics teacher at the pre-K to 12 Riverside School in Ahmedabad, India. “We want to understand whether they’ve understood the concepts, so we close the loop with reflection.”
Just like “contracting your bicep at the top of a dumbbell curl,” quick reflective closure activities “squeeze extra oomph into a lesson,” writes Todd Finley, a professor of English education at East Carolina University. They’re an opportunity to surface and correct misunderstandings, emphasize key points, and consolidate recently learned content. Plus, they can help plot out important next steps in instruction.

There’s not always time for closing activities, of course—even ones that require limited advance planning. But when you can spare a few minutes, especially at key junctures like the end of a chapter or project, they can offer brief but powerful opportunities to “correct, clarify, and celebrate,” says Finley.

Finger Facts: On a piece of paper, have students trace the outline of their hand. Each student writes down a key concept from the lesson on the palm of their drawing, adding a relevant fact to each finger. Have the class share their responses in pairs or small groups. (Sourced from Wendy Savage) 
Two-Dollar Summary: Tell students that each word they use is worth 10 cents, and they must write a two-dollar summary of what they learned in class today. (Sourced from Ann Lewis and Aleta Thompson)
Here’s What You Missed: In pairs, students complete a bulleted list of key takeaways from the day’s lesson to share with classmates who were absent. Encourage students to be thorough, as their peers may be encountering much of this information for the first time. (Sourced from Paul Holimon)
Rock, Paper, Scissors: Students identify the lesson’s most challenging element (the rock), a central concept they should write down to remember (the paper), and the least critical details they can cut (the scissors). (Sourced from Shannon Kenyon) 
Let Them Cheat: Ask students to create a “cheat sheet” for an upcoming quiz on the material they learned that day. They’ll need to rank facts, formulas, or vocabulary based on importance and synthesize key information. (Sourced from Ann Sipe)
This One Thing: Toward the end of the lesson, each student must describe the day’s lesson using a single word. To add a bit of movement, have students stand up and walk around the room, sharing their word with peers and explaining why they chose it. (Sourced from Jason Kennedy)
“What I Know Now” Gallery Walk: On a sticky note, each student writes down one new thing they feel confident enough to share from the lesson. After posting them on the wall, students walk around the room reading peers’ reflections. (Sourced from Greg Evans)
Three Ws: Students respond to three questions on sticky notes, index cards, or a sheet of paper that they hand in as they leave the classroom:
What did we learn today?
So what? (Why is this relevant, important, or useful?)
Now what? (Can you predict where the next lesson will go from here?)
(Sourced from Ann Sipe)
Singing Scholars: Students summarize main ideas from the lesson to the tune of their favorite song. They can record on their phones or, if some are feeling brave, perform it for the class! (Sourced from Todd Finley)  
Random Question Generator: Type up several closed and open-ended questions connected to the day’s or week’s learning and collect them in a container. One student reaches in and grabs a question for the class to answer. For example: What can you tell me about functions? Or, what is the formula for the area of a circle? (Sourced from Beth Fulmer)
Vocab in Verse: Choose a vocabulary word and write it on the board, then students create acrostic poems explaining what they’ve learned in class that day. (Sourced from Kristin Shapiro)
Anything to Add?: For students who have prior knowledge about a lesson or topic, ask the class to answer this question before leaving: Is there anything else about this topic that you know but I didn’t ask you? (Sourced from Kimberly Stiff) 
Thumbs Up/Thumbs Down: Create a short list of content-specific multiple-choice questions, and have students respond silently by simply putting a thumb up for A, down for B, pointed to the left for C, and to the right for D. Choose a couple of students at random to explain their choice. (Sourced from Ann Sipe) 
Take a Selfie: Students take a selfie of themselves making a face that represents how they feel about the day’s lesson. Ask them to include a caption that explains their choice. For a phoneless alternative, have students choose an emoji that best describes their feelings. (Sourced from Tarita Reeves) 
Jeopardy in Reverse: Provide an answer to the class—silver, for example. Next, have students each write a question that would lead them to that answer. For example, “Which element has the symbol Ag?” (Sourced from Ann Sipe)
Reflect Ball: After writing a handful of reflective questions—like “What strategies helped you learn today?”—on an inflatable beach ball with a dry erase marker, toss the ball around the room. The question a student’s hand touches when they catch the ball is the one they’ll answer aloud; then they pass the ball to a classmate. (Sourced from Eman Bekheet) 
Human Bar Graph: Create a long line with tape from one side of the room to the other. Toward the end of class, ask kids to place themselves on the line according to their level of understanding. Students who are confused line up on the left, students who feel confident on the right. Those who are unsure can stand in the middle. Kids can ask questions of their peers, then move along the line as their comprehension changes in real time. (Sourced from Literacy Minnesota) 
Muddiest Point: Ask students to identify where they lack clarity by answering the prompt, “What was most confusing to me about the material in class today?” Extend the activity by asking them to also identify their clearest point. (Sourced from Kimberly D. Tanner and Melanie Smith) 
Finger Signals: After raising a hand to chest level, students put up the number of fingers that correspond to their understanding of the topic:
5—I can teach this to my classmate.
4—I understand this well.
3—I need more examples.
2—I need you to teach it again. 
1—I’m as lost as a sock in a dryer! (or something funny)
(Sourced from Mel Mercado)
Definition Dash: Allow students to briefly discuss vocabulary in small groups. Toward the end of class, everyone lines up and, in their own words, each student defines a key term to you before exiting the classroom. Students who struggle step aside and wait for a few of their peers to go by before trying again. Keep the tone light so that students don’t feel singled out. (Sourced from Ann Sipe) 
Think and Twist: To see how students’ thinking has changed from the start of the lesson to the end, have them answer the following prompt: “I used to think… now I think…” (Sourced from Jillian Coneys)
Quiz the Next Class: Have students work together to craft three quiz questions—could be true/false or multiple choice—that you will have the next class answer. (Sourced from Todd Finley)
Where Does This Fit?: Have students create a sequence of newly learned concepts on a line in their notebooks—based on chronological order, on importance of each topic, or in order from simple to most complex. For example, students learning about the water cycle could do this activity with terms like evaporation, condensation, and precipitation. (Sourced from Ann Sipe)
Fireworks and Feedback: Similar to highlighting roses and thorns, ask students to celebrate and share their fireworks—learning that sparked joy or a moment where a concept really clicked—and feedback, input from peers or teachers that helped them take a step forward. (Sourced from Jason Kennedy) 
WHAT DID WE MISS?
We received so many amazing suggestions from our educator community for this list. If you have your own favorite closure activities, please share them in the comments."
ScienceAndEducation,1015,"When the end of a term approaches, educator social media is full of images and commentary on the sheer amount of grading that will be coming their way. From images of monstrous waves or an exhausted teacher grasping a large cup of coffee, the stress is palpable. So how do we make this better for everyone, including teachers, students, families, case coordinators, and everyone else struggling at the end of the term?
As educators, we want to be considerate of the fact that students have yet to acquire excellent management skills. But we also need to protect our own mental health and teach students the responsibility that comes with completing assignments and turning in work. 
DESIGNING A LATE WORK POLICY WITH STUDENTS
Some years back, I had a high school world language class with a wonderful group of students—but getting work from them was challenging on a good day. After one particularly exhausting end of the term when I received a monumental amount of late work, I flatly said, “We can’t do this again.” Shockingly, they agreed. I gave the class 30 minutes to discuss as a class what they thought could be a fair policy. The requirements were simple: 
1. Simplicity. This policy had to be easy for me to manage as a teacher.
2. Accountability. It couldn’t be a free-for-all with no accountability. 
I could easily write a separate article on how to have students design class policies, but that is for a different time. Here is what the students came up with as a proposal:
Assessment as final deadline: All homework and classwork is accepted full credit until the assessment—then it is not accepted at all. This also counts for any retakes (or corrections) to other activities or smaller assessments. 
The 55 percent rule: If a student does the large majority of the assignments up until assessment, they do not get less than 55 percent on any assessment. This gives students an incentive to get their work done and make arrangements with the teacher to keep on track. It should be very unlikely that a student will do the majority of assignments related to an assessment and get below 55 percent. However, if it does happen, they know that there are policies in place to help them.
If a student does get below 55 percent and has done the large majority of the work, this forces me as an educator to consider the cause. Did other students have similar troubles? If so, was the assessment reflective of the work done in class? If this student was an outlier, perhaps they simply had a rough day (which does happen)?
Assessment as proof of competency: If a student is missing an assignment and they get above a certain score on the assessment, they can get partial credit for any missing work related to the assessment. The students were very clear that this was not a reason to not do work, but rather it was to allow students to focus on critical assignments if they get behind. 
Assessment as redo attempt: If a student does well on a final unit assessment, they can have their grade raised for smaller assessments leading up to that larger one. This was because they showed understanding in areas where they had struggled before. 
Once this policy was created, I shared it with all my sections. Students overwhelmingly supported it. So, we decided to implement it on a trial basis. Once that was a success, I shared this with colleagues, and they implemented it in their classrooms as well. It is now a regular course policy and is shared in all of my course syllabi.

A POLICY THAT WORKS FOR TEACHERS AND STUDENTS
After we set this policy up in my classroom, I observed a variety of benefits.
Morale boost for teacher and students: There was an immediate turnaround for both me and my students. Students who felt that failure was inevitable were motivated and engaged. And I felt better about giving students another chance-–but with boundaries. 
Increased accountability: Students held each other accountable for their own success and admitted when they were not putting in their effort. Parents were highly supportive; it was clear why a student was not successful, and this saved a lot of time responding to parent emails.
Better-quality work: Work was less rushed, which led to better quality, deeper learning, and stronger assessment scores. Students told me they had often rushed through work so it wouldn’t be marked late, but this gave them time to do quality work and therefore learn in the process.
Students did the work: Very few students used the “proof of competency policy” as a chance to simply not do work. Rather, this policy helped students prioritize missing work if they got really behind. Although I worried that this policy might be taken advantage of, only a small handful of students tried—and they realized very quickly that this was not a recipe for success. 
Range of grades: There was still a wide range of grades. Highly skilled students who had an excellent understanding of the content still earned excellent grades. Those who struggled earned grades that weren’t quite as high, but they felt empowered with the recognition of their efforts.
So why does this policy work? I believe there are two main reasons. The first is assurance. Provided they do “their part,” students feel that they can be successful and are assured that their efforts do matter. If they make mistakes, life events make submitting work challenging, or the content gets particularly hard for them, there are structures in place to help them. Second, there is a sense of control for the students. Students crave the opportunity to have control over their future, and they are able to recognize what is fair and how they (and their classmates) should be held accountable for their responsibilities.  "
ScienceAndEducation,1657,"Quick learning “pulse checks” during and after lessons can be a powerful way to “improve and enhance student learning,” says veteran teacher and author Jay McTighe. Designed to assess students’ understanding of concepts or their ability to apply new skills, formative assessments can also inform next instructional steps.
Importantly, they’re generally not graded, since the point of these in-process checks is to “obtain feedback to use in improving teaching and learning, not to evaluate learning,” McTighe clarifies. “It’s important that students understand the purpose of these techniques, that mistakes are OK—and even expected—and that they will not be graded on their responses.”
Drawing from our archives and hundreds of comments on the topic from educators across our social media channels, we compiled a list of quick, low-stakes—and fun!—formative assessments designed to offer a variety of low-lift, flexible options in your classroom.
Write a Headline: Following a lesson, ask students to write a headline about it. Teacher Sarah Cook caps her students’ headlines at six words: “They really have to think about what is most crucial to say,” she writes on our Facebook feed.
Sit Down/Stand Up: Midway through a lesson, or at the end, ask the class several true/false questions related to what you just covered and have them stand up if they agree, stay seated if they don’t, or squat if they’re uncertain, suggests educator Celeste Kirsh. To make kids comfortable, educator Jess Mark asks students to keep their eyes shut during this quick check for understanding.
Draw a Comic: After a lesson, “ask students to draw the lesson in a comic strip—max five frames,” proposes educator Kim Allsup, then have them explain the comic to classmates. It’s a helpful review strategy, and kids gain insights into what their peers found important about the lesson, says Allsup.

Color Cards: Periodically, stop the lesson and have students hold up color cards. Green means “Keep going, I understand”; yellow means “I’m a little confused”; red means “Stop, I need help.” We heard several variations: Bobin Manchanda has students write their names on Post-it notes and stick them in green, yellow, or red zones on the board. Sarah Marlatt Petrie’s students place a green or red dot on their desk to show their understanding, an approach that helps “other students identify an ‘expert’ when working in groups or pairs,” Petrie writes.
Mini Debate: In class, select a few student “experts” to debate or discuss a topic you’ve just covered while the rest of the class listens, suggests Todd Finley, a professor of English education at East Carolina University. If you record it, you can even have students turn the discussion into a mini podcast using free audio editing software like Audacity.
Connect to Your Life: Educator Sarah Nawras Sandouk uses a strategy that she calls Connect to Life Objective. “Whether it’s a poem, a text, a history fact, or even a grammar rule,” she asks students to explain how they’ll use something they’ve learned in their day-to-day lives.
Create a Quiz: Students can write a set of test questions related to the lesson they’ve just had, then pick two of them to answer in a paragraph, Finley suggests. For a twist, consider having students trade papers to answer each other’s questions.
Quick Check-In: At the end of class, ask students to “take a selfie, or use an emoji, that represents how you felt about today’s lesson,” proposes teacher Tarita Reeves. “Include a caption that tells what you learned that made you feel this way.”
Compose an Acrostic: Have students pick a vocabulary word or key term from the day’s lesson and write an acrostic poem—a short poem where each line begins with the next letter in the chosen word—suggests Kristin Shapiro.
Knowledge Walk: On the whiteboard or on sticky notes hung around the class, students can write a single sentence summarizing something new they learned, says educator Greg Evans on our thread on X. Then the class strolls around the classroom reading what their peers have written.
Have a Chat: If you have the time, quick one-on-one conversations with students—scheduled or off the cuff—can reveal what they understand and what they’re struggling with. “Five minutes per student would take quite a bit of time,” says educator and education researcher Laura Thomas, “but you don’t have to talk to every student about every project or lesson.”
Tweet It: Have students write a 280-character tweet summarizing a central takeaway from the lesson, suggests Finley. And if there’s time, have students write responses to each other’s tweets, says educator Jackie Ferguson. Consider having students generate related keywords or hashtags, too.
Use Your Hands: McTighe recommends hand signals to quickly gauge kids’ understanding:
Thumbs up: I understand _____ and can explain it in my own words.
Wave hand: I’m not completely sure about _____ and doubt I could explain it.
Thumbs down: I don’t yet understand _____ and cannot explain it.
Holding up fingers also works, says Sherri Rockstad Simpson, who asks students to hold up fingers from one to five to quickly show their level of understanding. 
Note It: Ask students to write one takeaway from the lesson on a sticky note, then affix the notes to a poster or whiteboard so classmates can browse and learn from their peers, suggests educator Kim Roberts.
Misconception Check: Give students a common misconception about the topic they’re studying. Their first challenge is to identify the flaw or error in the statement, says McTighe. The bigger challenge: correct the error with an accurate explanation.
Assess Yourself: The ability to assess their own learning is an important metacognitive skill for students. “You can give your rubric to your students and have them spot their strengths and weaknesses,” says Thomas. For a lighter lift, write three or four topics on the board that you think the whole class should work on, then have students write their names under the topic they need the most help with.
Just One Word: Have students provide a single word to describe a person, event, or concept they learned about. “I’m always amazed at the creative, thought-provoking words the kids come up with,” writes Meredith Adelman.
Summary Poem: Ask students to list 10 useful vocabulary words from an assigned text, then write a free-verse poem using those words, says Finley. Or have them write a quick summary of the reading that incorporates their 10 chosen vocab words.
Concept Maps: Many teachers use graphic organizers and concept maps to support learning—but they can also work as formative assessments, writes McTighe. For example, students might draw a visual web of factors affecting plant growth or develop a concept map to illustrate how a bill becomes a law.
Help Me Plan: At the end of a lesson, educator Mark Hansen breaks his class into small groups at separate tables to discuss how their learning went. Groups report back to Hansen to share “what we should review or clarify tomorrow, and where we should go deeper.”
3-2-1: Many teachers in our audience check for understanding via 3-2-1 prompts—with some interesting variations. Meghan Mannarino asks for three things students learned, two things they found interesting, and one question they have. Jessica Case-Martinez, meanwhile, starts her 3-2-1 by asking for three words to describe the day; Lorraine says on Instagram that she ends with one connection they can make about the class material.
A $2 Summary: Tell students that they have a $2.00 budget to summarize the day’s lesson or a recent reading, and each word costs 10 cents. Besides quickly showing students’ grasp of the lesson’s key idea, this activity gets elementary-age students engaging in mathematical thinking, says educator Sunaina Sharma.
What Are Others Wondering?: To avoid the sea of blank stares after he prompts his class to ask questions, educator Paul Holimon suggests a different approach: Ask students to “think of a question you think someone else in the class might have about today’s lesson. This solves the problem of a student thinking, ‘I don’t have any questions.’”
Vote With Your Feet: Hang four signs in the corners of your classroom: “Agree,” “Mostly Agree,” “Mostly Disagree,” and “Disagree.” Then read statements related to the day’s lesson—for example, “Orwell was trying to call attention to animal rights with Old Major’s speech”—and ask students to agree or disagree by migrating to the appropriate corner of the room, writes an educator from Rhode Island on Instagram. 
One Minute Jot: Teacher Angie Huels gives students 60 seconds to write a reflection on the day’s lesson, answering the following prompts: Name the most important thing you learned in class today; what questions do you still have?; and offer a suggestion about our class.
Help a Classmate: At the end of a lesson, students with questions can write them on the whiteboard, and classmates who think they know the answer can write a response below the question—or volunteer to discuss the topic one-on-one, writes educator Heather Brown.
Get Creative: “Whether students draw, create a collage, or sculpt,” a creative formative assessment can help students “synthesize their learning,” writes Thomas. “They can create a dance to model cell mitosis or act out stories like Ernest Hemingway’s ‘Hills Like White Elephants’ to explore the subtext,” she adds.
Teach Someone: To expose gaps in students’ understanding, ask them to “teach a new concept or skill to someone else—a new student, a student who has just returned from absence, or a younger child,” writes McTighe. Or have students write a letter explaining a new concept to a friend, Finley suggests.
HELP OTHER TEACHERS OUT!
What are your favorite ways to check for understanding? Please share your strategies and ideas in the comments so other teachers can try them out in their classrooms."
ScienceAndEducation,1030,"It can feel challenging to know how to transition into collaborative work in a meaningful way during instruction—a way that allows each student to share their ideas with peers, which we know is a critical skill.
There are many ways to approach this instructional goal, but perhaps the most successful strategy I’ve stumbled upon this year is that of collaborative slide deck competitions. Though they do require some prep work, the in-class experience and student learning that they yield has made them one of my favorite routines in the classroom. 
COLLABORATIVE SLIDE DECKS
It’s common for teachers, after students do an individual exploration (example: reading a short text and marking it up for keywords or questions), to ask them to form groups and compile their thinking on poster paper, which they share with classmates through a gallery walk.
While I know this activity works great for many, this year I’ve found a different path: I ask students to create a collaborative Google Slides deck, each group taking ownership over their slide. Unlike posters that eventually pile up and get recycled, collaborative slide decks become living documents to use in the classroom.

TEACHER PREP WORK
To prepare for this activity, I look at the different outputs I’m hoping students will produce and pre-populate a slide deck with relevant prompts for each. 
I always include a sample slide that is fully completed (using a different text or situation); I also ensure that there are enough blank slides for each group and that the “share” settings allow everyone to both access and edit the document. 
PRE-ACTIVITY WORK FOR STUDENTS
Giving students time to invest in their individual findings and interpretations before group work is key. 
When teaching a poem, for example, I have all students read it individually and make initial annotations. They then have tangible ideas to share with each other. It’s helpful to share the outputs you want students to be working toward, whether a specific type of annotation (example: Marisa Thompson’s TQE Method) or guiding questions you’ve shared with the class. It’s important to ensure that students are independently heading in a shared direction.
Finally, I recommend walking students through a sample slide deck before they begin their independent work. This allows them to see what they will work on as a group and will help to make their independent work feel purposeful.
TRANSITIONING INTO THE ACTIVITY
When everyone has done their independent work and you’re ready to transition into the group stage, make sure that each group knows which slide they own. I have one member from each team add their group name to the slide. 
At this point, I’ve found it important to have students close their computers and share individual findings with each other before beginning the digital activity. If you skip this stage, groups can fall into the trap of having a handful of members type up what they found individually—and you miss the important opportunity to give each student a chance to voice aloud their findings and questions. 
I have students take roles in their group: Only one or two take the role of the recorders. Others can support them in completing the slide (editors); make sure that all voices are represented on the slide (advocates); and get support from me while keeping an eye on the time (logistics). I give students 10–15 minutes to complete the slide, sharing a running clock on the screen.
For you as the teacher, this is a great time to circle the room and observe group dynamics. You can also monitor the digital slides to see each group’s progress unfold. 
CLASSROOM APPLICATIONS
This year, I’ve used collaborative slide decks in my English classes for three activities.
TQE close-reading with a new text: When reading a short story or article, I ask students to annotate with their own thoughts and questions. As a group, they then determine the most meaningful and arrive at collective epiphanies or deeper understandings, which they share on their slide.
Mini-background research: When starting a new novel, I create slides for different pieces of historical context that will help students understand the text. Students try to learn as much as they can individually, within a given time window, then work collaboratively to share and cross-check what they’ve found, presenting findings via a collaborative slide deck.
Targeted skill analysis: My students applied and discussed poetry analysis skills (e.g., connotation, shifts, analogies, etc.) by independently identifying them in a text, then collaborating to share their findings via slides while discussing different interpretations or findings and deliberating about how to come to consensus.
POST-ACTIVITY ENGAGEMENT
Once the activity timer is up, I lock access to the slide deck so that students can only view it. I then have students dive into other groups’ slides. One way to do so is through a stationary gallery walk: They explore the others’ slides and make notes on what they feel is most interesting or important, then share with the class what they learned from peers’ works. 
You can also have students vote anonymously via a Google Form about which slide is most impressive to them and why, which creates space for you to collect peer affirmations focused on learning. I like to then go through each slide as a class and celebrate a specific finding or choice that students made.
Collaborative slide decks become excellent resources to support further learning—a tool to come back to later in the unit to track growth. They also help absent students to access the day’s learning. 
THE ‘WHY’
Sometimes it feels like collaborative learning is an either-or experience: You can lean into the collaboration or instead prioritize the learning. 
This is a false choice, I believe, and I’ve found this activity to be one of the most reliable ways to do both. It breaks up the classroom routine, gets students working with a collective purpose, and lends a helpful document to use in your classroom going forward."
ScienceAndEducation,1221,"During the height of the pandemic, like countless other high school history teachers, I struggled to keep my students focused on their learning. When the world is in the grip of a once-in-a-century health crisis, it’s understandable that minds will wander.
In response to the challenges of remote learning and to keep my students engaged, I reached out to Kenneth C. Davis, author of More Deadly Than War: The Hidden History of the Spanish Flu and the First World War. To stay relevant to current events and address my students’ interests, I integrated a chapter from his book into the revised curriculum.
As the Covid-19 pandemic continued, my students’ eagerness to derive insights from Davis’s work also grew, as a way of better understanding their current circumstances. When I emailed Davis about whether he would Zoom with my students, he enthusiastically agreed.
“Only time will reveal the extent to which the lessons from my book have informed our approach to successfully tackling this pandemic,” I recall Davis telling my class.
Last month, almost precisely four years later, Davis reconnected with my current juniors, who had just finished reading his book in full. He highlighted the lack of a strong federal response during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic.
From that point on, my students eagerly posed questions to Davis, their interest piqued to understand the past and enhance their understanding of the present.

ENHANCED ENGAGEMENT IN READING AND WRITING
Building on those early successes, I now place great emphasis on Zooming with scholars. Whenever possible, I inform my students that at the end of a unit, they will have the opportunity to engage in an intellectual discussion with the author of the book we’re examining.
“Strive for excellence in your questions and insights,” I encourage my students. “Let’s aim to leave a lasting impression on the author with the depth of your understanding and curiosity.” This method fuels their enthusiasm, as they enjoy the healthy challenge—not just to impress me and themselves, but also to leave a lasting impression on the author.
This approach also serves as a catalyst for student engagement in weekly breakout seminars. To further foster their preparedness, I assign an exercise that I call “two prompts and a response,” requiring students to devise two questions on a specific segment of the assigned reading and then answer one. 
While there is no set length for the assignment, I ask students to “create and submit two thought-provoking seminar questions based on the week’s assigned reading. Additionally, choose one of your questions and provide a succinct answer. Ensure that your response is clear, concise, and maintains a formal tone. When appropriate, use relevant quotes from the reading to enhance and support your analysis.” This task not only equips students for active engagement in seminars, but also allows me to give focused feedback on their written work each week.
This process also directly promotes their ability to engage in meaningful conversations with authors.
For example, one student asked Davis about President Woodrow Wilson’s notable silence regarding the Spanish flu, quoting passages from More Deadly Than War to inform her remarks: “What do you think of, and how can you explain, Wilson’s muted stance? Furthermore, why do you believe that Covid-19 received a similar lack of seriousness by so many in 2020? What explains the continuation of this pattern?”
This interview demonstrated not only the depth of her preparation, but also the relevance of the questions to contemporary issues. Davis was likewise impressed, writing on X (formerly Twitter) that my students “asked great questions” and were “enthusiastic, curious, and a pleasure to meet.” The proof is in the pudding.
In an educational climate that increasingly favors (and funds) science, technology, and math over the humanities, engaging with historians breathed new life into history for my students. The interviews stimulated them to approach my class with heightened gravity and renewed enthusiasm.
ENHANCED PARTICIPATION IN DISCUSSION
When I announce that an author will visit the classroom, students tend to become more proactive and diligent. However, there are subtler benefits beyond heightened engagement. My introverted students, who sometimes struggle to participate in everyday discussion, appear temporarily more willing to play the role of extrovert. Witnessing usually quiet students initiate questions, under the attentive eyes of their peers, is rewarding beyond measure.
My approach here is informed by Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can’t Stop Talking, by Susan Cain, whom I interviewed about teaching various personality types.
“I hear too many stories of children who are given the message by very well-meaning teachers that there’s something wrong with the way they are,” Cain told me. “I think well-meaning teachers see their role as being to turn introverts into extroverts. We really need to understand that an introvert is a totally normal personality type.”
When I communicate with introverted students about the heavily discussion-oriented nature of my class, I often reengage with Cain’s insights. Imagine my elation when one such student, in a moment of deep self-reflection, recently confided to me the significant anxiety he had faced at the beginning of the year. He now finds genuine enjoyment in participating in these activities.
“The prospect of meeting with Davis got me really excited,” he said. “In previous units, I did not contribute as much during discussions and seminars. But knowing I would have a chance to speak with the author really motivated me to take more risks, and I’m glad that I did.”
Despite not posing a question directly to Davis during the Zoom, this student entrusted me to ask one on his behalf. At that moment, I couldn’t help but celebrate his initiative and the trust he had placed in me. 
During the peak of the pandemic, I experienced a similarly enriching moment when Peter Kornbluh, a senior analyst at the National Security Archive, held a virtual session with my Latin American History students.
He shared insights into the future of historical research, saying, “In three to four years, you’ll be able to review declassified documents about what Donald Trump knew from the intelligence community regarding the virus’s spread, his awareness of the timing, his reactions, and his inactions. This topic is currently under discussion in the press. However, when these documents are eventually declassified, I hope you’ll remember our conversation today, seek out those documents, and read them.”
I recently reached out again to Kornbluh, asking about the possibility of his sharing his insights and predictions with my current students. To my delight, he agreed.
In my experience, scholars typically welcome the opportunity to engage with students—often at no charge—valuing the chance to listen to the students’ views. As for obtaining contact details, I usually locate an email address by visiting the homepage of the author or the publisher. You might also consider sending a brief message through social media to ask about the possibility of sending a follow-up message with more details. Regarding the content of the email request, I created an outline that has proven successful for me. I hope that you find it helpful."
