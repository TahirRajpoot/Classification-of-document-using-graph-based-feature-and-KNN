Travel,1442,"THE 6 BEST HOTELS IN COPENHAGEN

Posted: 4/26/24 | April 26th, 2024
A compact capital with more bikes than cars, Copenhagen is a lively, modern city perfect for weekend getaways.
Copenhagen is also considered one of the world’s happiest cities, boasting plenty of green space, cool museums, and a rambunctious nightlife. Famed for its cyclist-friendly streets, there’s not only more bikes than cars here, there’s actually more bikes than people!
I’ve been visiting the city on and off for over 16 years and always have a blast. The quality of life here is virtually unrivaled. And while the city is expensive, it’s definitely possible to visit without breaking the bank.
To help you plan your trip, here’s my list of the best hotels in Copenhagen:
1. Hotel Bethel

This three-star hotel is situated right on the canal in the center of Indre By, the most picturesque area of town. The hotel comprises three historic buildings, with large and spacious rooms that are clean and comfortable. The décor is modern, though a little dated, and generally quite minimalist (don’t expect much art or color). The carpeted rooms include a flatscreen TV, a desk, wardrobe, and free Wi-Fi. There’s no coffee/tea maker in the room, but I appreciate that the lounge has free coffee and tea 24/7. The breakfast, while not included, is filling and has a lot of variety, though it’s mostly cold foods like pastries, cold cuts, and cereal. The bathrooms are a bit small, but they are clean and the showers have great water pressure.
While there’s no gym or other facilities on site, the hotel has larger rooms perfect for families or groups. And you really can’t beat the location. It’s an affordable, central, no-frills choice.
Book here!

  2. Hotel Ottilia

Part of the former Carlsberg brewery, Otilia is a four-star property that has won several architecture awards for its transformation into a hotel. Located in Vesterbro, an area known for its excellent eateries and third-wave coffee shops, the standard rooms here are stylish but minimal, emphasizing contrasting light and dark tones. Rooms feature Wi-Fi, flatscreen TVs with Netflix, coffee/tea markers, and cozy chairs. If you’re on a budget and traveling solo, they have smaller rooms available too. The bathrooms have chic dark tile and include complimentary toiletries. I love that the bathroom floors are heated, so you stay nice and warm even in the winter. The shower pressure is great too, though just be aware that some rooms have open bathroom designs so privacy is limited.
Breakfast is filling and I especially like that it’s 100% organic. It’s served on the top floor so you can take in the view as you enjoy the fresh spread. Another nice touch is the daily happy hour with complimentary wine.
Book here!

  3. Hotel Sct. Thomas

This three-star hotel is just a short walk from the Central Station and the Tivoli Gardens amusement park. Located in trendy Vesterbro, the rooms here are compact but functional, with a cozy Danish-inspired design featuring taupe and sage-green walls along with hardwood or parquet floors. The simple rooms feature a flatscreen TV, a small desk, clothes rack, and free Wi-Fi. The bathrooms are also quite small, but the showers have decent water pressure. A tasty organic breakfast of fresh bread, fruit, and pastries is offered each morning too.
There’s also a chic lobby bar and a rooftop terrace to hang out on, complete with a bar and a sauna (you have to book and pay to use it though). The hotel was completely renovated in 2024 and is clean, comfortable, and perfect for budget travelers.
Book here!

  4. Boutique Hotel Herman K

This four-star hotel located in Nyhavn is in a historic transformer station, so the entire place has a chic industrial style. The lobby is especially striking; it’s over two stories high and features a huge 3D-printed sculpture. I like that there’s a cool cocktail bar here too.
The large rooms feature minimal décor and have big windows that let in a lot of natural light. Rooms include soft beds, air conditioning, a Bose sound system, a flatscreen TV, comfy armchairs, a minibar, kettle, and free Wi-Fi. The marble bathrooms are bright and roomy, with complimentary eco-friendly toiletries and excellent water pressure. The breakfast each morning has lots of options (including veg options), and can be ordered as a buffet, a la carte, or continental. There’s no gym or spa on-site, but with its central location, you can pretty much walk to all the main sights from here. It’s a stylish, central choice.
Book here!

  5. Hotel Nora

Located in the diverse Nørrebro neighborhood, this three-star hotel sits in an ornate 19th-century building. The rooms here are airy and bright and let in a lot of natural light. The décor is minimalist, but the rooms feature bright carpet that really makes the space pop. Amenities include a flatscreen TV, work desk, minifridge, coffee/tea maker, and free Wi-Fi. The bathrooms are a little dated, but they have good water pressure and complimentary toiletries.
A fresh Danish breakfast is available each morning, and you can choose what you’d like to eat in advance (you order the night beforehand). I especially like that you get a bottle of water and a beer when you check in. There’s even a small rooftop terrace where you can hang out and enjoy the view over the city.
Book here!

  6. Hotel Skt Petri

If you really want to splash out, this five-star hotel is located in Copenhagen’s old Latin Quarter, just minutes away from the main shopping street. The stylish rooms are large and invite in a lot of natural light. They feature darker tones and lots of dark blue, which contrasts nicely with the wooden furniture and minimal artwork. The beds are big and comfy, and rooms include a flatscreen TV, desk, minibar, coffee/tea maker, and parquet or hardwood floors. The large bathrooms are bright and boast complimentary toiletries and plush bathrobes.
There’s a bar in the expansive lobby (the hotel even crafts its own gin), a fitness center on-site, and parking is available for anyone traveling with a car. The breakfast is especially tasty, with fresh waffles, eggs, pastries, fruit, granola, and more. If you want to splurge, stay here.

Travel,1336,"THE 6 BEST HOTELS IN DUBROVNIK

Posted: 4/22/24 | April 22nd, 2024
Dubrovnik is a gorgeous historic city. Perched on the rugged coast of Croatia, it explodes to life every summer as cruisers, backpackers, and beachgoers flock to the city. With medieval charm, a UNESCO Old Town, and the glimmering azure backdrop of the Adriatic Sea, it’s no surprise that this is the most popular city in Croatia.
While the city struggles with overtourism, it’s easy to escape the crowds and soak up the local pace of life if you know where to go (and where to stay).
I’ve visited Dubrovnik a bunch over the years. These days, there are a lot more hotels than when I first arrived. Some are great, some are not so great. To help you plan your visit, here’s my list of the best hotels in Dubrovnik:
1. Art Hotel

This beachfront three-star hotel is just a two-minute stroll to the main beach in Lapad. The bright rooms are simply furnished and feature light, natural tones and small pieces of colorful artwork. The rooms have balconies, some of them with nice views, and also air conditioning, large flatscreen TVs, minibars, and a desk. The bathrooms aren’t huge (and the showers are a bit small), but they feature colorful tile, slippers, complimentary toiletries, and the water pressure is good.
The staff is amazing and the complimentary continental breakfast each morning is delicious, with a varied spread of local homemade food (like burek, a type of pastry) that changes daily. The main draw here is the location though. You can’t beat it if you want something near the beach!
Book here!

  2. Hotel Adria

This relaxing four-star hotel boasts two swimming pools as well as a spa and fitness center, making it a great choice for travelers looking to unwind. The rooms here are spacious and bright, with big beds and large windows that let in a lot of natural light. The décor is minimalist, with calming white and tan tones. Most rooms have balconies that look out over the marina, as well as a flatscreen TV, desk, safe, and coffee/tea maker. The bathrooms are also bright and spacious and the showers have great water pressure.
There’s also a varied (and included) buffet breakfast each morning with lots of options (including fresh fruit, pastries, juice, cereals). If you have a car, use of the hotel’s parking garage is complimentary.
Book here!

  3. Royal Palm Hotel

This five-star hotel in the Lapad neighborhood is one of the more affordable luxury options in town. The rooms here are a bit dated (the carpet and décor aren’t super modern) but they are spacious and airy and many offer gorgeous ocean views. Rooms include a TV, electric kettle, desk, minibar, and convenient outlets near the bed. The bathrooms are also large and bright, with stylish tile or marble, bathrobes, and complimentary toiletries. Some even have deep soaking tubs.
The complimentary breakfast buffet offers lots of variety, including an egg station, mimosas, and fresh pastries. There’s a relaxing spa here as well, in addition to a pool and gym. The beach is nearby too, but I especially like that the on-site terrace restaurant offers sweeping panoramic views of the Adriatic.
Book here!

  4. Hotel Lero

Located in the less-touristy Montovjerna neighborhood, this inviting four-star hotel is built around a relaxing outdoor pool. The rooms overlook the Adriatic and are spacious, featuring unique décor and design touches, such as colorful art or murals. Rooms also have air conditioning, minibars, coffeemakers, satellite TV, and large wardrobes.
The bathrooms are simple but the water pressure in the showers is great, plush bathrobes are included, and some rooms have both a bathtub and a shower. There are several fantastic restaurants here too, including a poolside bar, an award-winning Bosnian restaurant, and a Mediterranean restaurant offering a complimentary daily breakfast buffet with plenty of options for all diets.
Book here!

  5. Hotel More

This luxurious cliffside hotel is perched right on the water. A five-star hotel, all the rooms here have balconies that face the shimmering Adriatic. As a bonus, the hotel boasts the most unique bar in the city: the Cave Bar More. As the name suggests, it’s set in an actual cave right on the water.
The rooms here are massive, with super comfy beds, lots of natural light, and calming tones. They are furnished simply but elegantly, with wooden desks and a separate seating area with a sofa or easy chairs. In-room amenities include a desk, flatscreen TV, coffee/tea maker, minibar, and safe. The bathrooms are also spacious and include slippers, cozy bathrobes, luxe toiletries, and great water pressure. A complimentary breakfast buffet is available each morning, with fresh fruit, cereal, eggs, and pastries.
If you want to splash out on luxury, this is the hotel for you.
Book here!

  6. St. Joseph’s Hotel

Housed in a historic 16th-century building near two beautiful beaches, St. Joseph’s is one of a few hotels located within the walls of the Old Town. You’ll have a choice between standard hotel rooms and studio/apartment rooms. No matter your choice, all the rooms here are unique, with design touches that include hardwood floors, exposed brick and wooden ceiling beams, chandeliers, and antique furniture. It feels more like a B&B than a hotel. Expect amenities like flatscreen TVs, desk, and coffee/tea makers. The larger rooms have kitchen and laundry facilities.
The bathrooms feature beautiful tile or marble, rain showers (some also have massive bathtubs), slippers, and plush bathrobes. I especially like that the complimentary a la carte breakfast is cooked by a chef and served in your room each morning. It’s a nice personal touch that really elevates the whole experience here.

A booming tourist destination, Dubrovnik is absolutely stunning. Sure, you’ll likely want to skip a visit in the middle of summer, but as long as you pick one of the hotels from the list above you’ll have an amazing stay in the Peal of the Adriatic.

Travel,4271,"HOW TO SPEND YOUR TIME IN TOKYO: A SUGGESTED ITINERARY

Last Updated: 4/22/24 | April 22nd, 2024
Tokyo is one of the most amazing cities in the world. It’s fast-paced, futuristic, and bursting with weird and wonderful activities to keep you busy, including gorgeous shrines, palaces, and temples; hip clubs and bars; and fashionable people and shopping, not to mention beautiful cherry blossoms.
Tokyo lives up to all the hype. If I could spend months living there, I would.
You never know what you’ll find here. One second you’ll run into a group of women dressed in pig masks and ’80s dresses and the next you’re in a robot café or a centuries-old temple.
It’s also one of the biggest cities in the world, home to almost 14 million people (almost 40 million if you count the metropolitan area). Not surprisingly, there are many nooks and crannies to explore in this city that seamlessly weave centuries-old Japanese traditions with modern technology. (So don’t rush your visit. You’re never going to see it all anyway, so don’t try!)
To help you plan your trip, here is my suggested itinerary based on over seven visits to Tokyo:
Tokyo Itinerary Highlights
Day 1: Fish Market, Imperial Palace, Harajuku, & more!
Day 2: Asakusa, Ueno Park, Sento, & more!
Day 3: Shinjuku, Shibuya, Quirky Cafes, & more!
Day 4: Take a Day Trip
Day 5: Sumo, Samurai, Meguro River, & more!
  Tokyo Itinerary: Day 1

(Note: There’s a lot listed for this day. Since you’re likely to wake up super early because of jet lag, you can fit it all in. You might not want to, though. Maybe you need an afternoon nap!)
Roam the Tsukiji and Toyosu Fish Markets
In 2018, Tokyo’s main fish market moved to Toyosu, which is twice the size of the old one, Tsukiji, making it the largest in the world. While a lot of good restaurants moved too (Sushi Dai being the most famous), I find the place itself very stale, since you can no longer wander the floor (you look down via a walkway above; you also need a visitor’s pass to enter).
The old outer market in Tsukiji is still great though, and you can still find food and stores there too. You can wander alone and just eat and shop until you can’t anymore! Most businesses open at 6am, so it’s a perfect place to go in the morning when you wake up early because of jet lag. Food and drink tours of the Tsukiji Outer Market are available for around 13,500 JPY.
Tsukiji Fish Market: 5 Chome-2-1 Tsukiji, Chuo, +81 3-3542-1111. Admission is free. Toyosu Fish Market: 6 Chome-6-2 Toyosu, Koto, +81 3-3520-8205. Open Monday-Saturday 5am-5pm, though most businesses don’t open until 7am. Admission is free.
Immerse yourself at teamLab Planets
This really fun and quirky digital art installation is a multisensory and immersive experience in which you become part of the artwork, walking barefoot through the four exhibition spaces and gardens as you interact with the installations. It takes an hour or so to go through. teamLab is quite popular and generally sells out at least a few days in advance, so I recommend getting your tickets online ahead of time.
6 Chome-1-16 Toyosu, Koto City, teamlab.art/e/planets. Open Monday-Sunday 9am-10pm; last entry is one hour before closing. Admission is 3,800 JPY for adults during weekdays and 4,200 JPY on weekends. Discounts are available for children and those with disabilities.
Admire the Imperial Palace
When the emperor moved from Kyoto to Tokyo in 1869, he took Edo for his new residence and renamed it Tokyo. Though you can’t go inside (or get very close), the building is amazing. It is surrounded by lovely grounds and a park, and there’s a moat around the stone walls. You can also see the changing of the guard, though it’s a relatively low-key and unassuming ceremony. Tokyo Localized offers a free walking tour of the gardens that is worth taking and lasts 2.5 hours. Admission to the grounds is free.
Feast below the Girders
Not far from the palace is the Yurakucho neighborhood. Below the elevated train tracks at Yurakucho Station is a 700-meter stretch of wine bars, beer pubs, and casual restaurants filled with businessmen. It’s a good spot for lunch, though it gets the most busy after work, when people stop in for food and happy hour on their way home.
Scale the Tokyo Tower
Built in 1957 and resembling the Eiffel Tower, the Tokyo Tower is taller (at 333 meters/1,092 feet) than its European version and made entirely of steel. It was the city’s tallest structure until the “Skytree” was built in 2010. You can pay to go all the way to the top floor to take in the view, but frankly, the main observation deck offers one that’s just as good.
4 Chome-2-8 Shibakoen, Minato, +81 3-3433-5111, tokyotower.co.jp. Open daily 9am-11pm. Admission is 1,200 JPY.
Relax at Meiji Jingu
Located at the northern end of Yoyogi Park, Meiji Jingu is a peaceful Shinto shrine honoring Emperor Meiji and Empress Shoken, who helped modernize Japan. It’s nestled in a serene forest, with a big wooden gate marking the entrance and paths lined with trees. You really don’t feel like you’re in one of the busiest, most densely populated cities in the world when you wander around here. Watch traditional ceremonies, stroll through the gardens, or check out the museum. (FYI: It gets really busy on the weekends.)
1-1 Yoyogikamizonocho, Shibuya City, +81 3-3379-5511, meijijingu.or.jp. Open every day of the year from sunrise to sunset. Admission is free.
Enjoy Yoyogi Park
One of Tokyo’s largest parks, Yoyogi is laced with walking paths, forested areas, and ponds. It is also used for music events and festivals throughout the year, and you’ll see many street performers and shops selling snacks. If you’re visiting in late March or early April, you’ll be able to catch the cherry blossoms. In the fall, the ginkgo forest takes on a beautiful golden color.
2-1 Yoyogikamizonocho, Shibuya City, +81 3-3469-6081, tokyo-park.or.jp/park/yoyogi. Open 24 hours, though some facilities have shorter opening times. Admission is free.
Get trendy in Harajuku
Harajuku is one of the most iconic districts in Tokyo. It’s renowned for its avant-garde take on fashion, it’s the epicenter of anime and kawaii (cuteness) culture in Tokyo, with lots of quirky and vintage-clothing stores and street art. Walking around the area, you’ll see all kinds of outfits, mostly worn by younger Japanese people (predominantly teenagers), making it a fun place to people-watch and window-shop. If you want to go shopping, this is one of the best areas to do it in. you’ll find a lot of the best Japanese designers here.
Dine with ninjas
For a unique dining experience, head to Ninja Tokyo (formerly Ninja Akasaka), a ninja-themed restaurant designed like an Edo-era building, with wait staff clothed in stereotypical all-black garb and trained in all sorts of tricks and illusions. You’ll order off old scrolls while being entertained by the skills of your server! It’s super fun.
Tokyu Plaza Akasaka, +81 3-5157-3936, ninja-tokyo.jp. Open daily 5pm-10pm, plus 11:30am-2pm on weekends.
Drink in Golden Gai
This district, lined with backstreet bars, may be touristy, but it’s one of the most fun in Tokyo. These zigzag alleys are filled with hole-in-the-wall bars serving cheap drinks. Each is unique, so it’s fun to pop in and out of them. It’s very touristy, but you’ll find a lot of Japanese people here too. It’s quite crowded on the weekends, so go early before the bars fill up.
If you want a deep dive into the area, take a food tour. Arigato Tours runs an evening tour around Golden Gai and Omoide Yokocho in Shinjuku that will show you around and let you sample the best ramen and yakitori in the area.
Tokyo Itinerary: Day 2

Check out Asakusa
If you want to see some of Tokyo’s historic religious sites, spend some time wandering around Asakusa. Just start as early as you can to avoid the crowds (especially if you plan on taking photos). These are two places not to be missed:
Senso-ji – Tokyo’s most popular and famous temple is beautifully painted and sits in a scenic spot near a pagoda and the impressive Kaminari Gate. There’s a huge statue of Kannon, the goddess of mercy, inside the main hall. 2 Chome-3-1 Asakusa, Taito, +81 3-3842-0181, senso-ji.jp. The grounds are open 24/7, though the temple itself is open daily 6am-5pm. Admission is free.
Asakusa Shrine – Not far from Senso-ji is this Shinto shrine, built during the Edo period and which survived the air raids of World War II. This is much more peaceful than Senso-ji, with fewer people, whom you’ll be able to see praying, meditating, or performing traditional rituals. 2 Chome-3-1 Asakusa, Taito, +81 3-3844-1575, asakusajinja.jp. Open daily 9am-4:30pm. Admission is free.
Explore Ueno Park
Spanning over 133 acres, Ueno Park is a lovely spot to spend the day. Various stalls and vendors sell snacks, drinks, and souvenirs. On weekends, there are usually cultural events or festivals showcasing traditional arts, music, and dance. During cherry blossom season, the park is full of people picnicking and admiring the thousands of trees. The park is also home to some of Tokyo’s best museums:
Tokyo National Museum –Established in 1872, this massive museum in the north end of the park houses one of the world’s largest collections of art and artifacts from Asia, particularly Japan. 13-9 Uenokoen, Taito, +81 3-3822-1111, tnm.jp. Open daily 9:30am-5pm (7pm on Fridays and Saturdays). Admission is 1,000 JPY.
Tosho-gu Shrine – This beautiful 17th-century Shinto shrine with carved gold doors and ornate carvings can also be found in the park. 9-88 Uenokoen, Taito, +81 3-3822-3455, uenotoshogu.com/en. Open daily 9am-5:30pm (4:30pm in winter). Admission is free up to the wall, though to go further inside is 500 JPY. To enter the shrine and peony garden costs 1,600 JPY. There’s also a combo ticket for the shrine and treasure hall for 2,100 JPY.
National Museum of Nature and Science – Opened in 1871, this museum houses exhibitions on pre-Meiji science. There are over 5,000,000 items in the collection, with 14,000 of them on permanent display. It’s also home to the taxidermied body of the legendary dog Hachiko, the loyal dog who would greet his owner at Shibuya Station on return from his daily commute (more on him later). 7-20 Uenokoen, +81 50-5541-8600, kahaku.go.jp. Open Tuesday-Sunday 9am-5pm. Admission is 630 JPY.
National Museum of Western Art – This is one of the only museums in the country to focus on Western art, established in 1959. The collection of almost 5,000 pieces extends from the Renaissance all the way to the 20th century. Expect to see works by masters like Van Gogh, Reubens, Renoir, Monet, Picasso, and many more! 7-7 Uenokoen, +81 3-3828-5131, nmwa.go.jp. Open Tuesday-Sunday 9:30am-5:30pm (8pm on Fridays and Saturdays). Admission is 500 JPY.
Browse Akihabara
Akihabara, or “Akiba,” is a bustling district in central Tokyo known for its vibrant electronics, anime, manga, and gaming culture. You’ll find streets full of gadgets, anime merchandise, card games, and collectibles. Stop and play in one of the plethora of video game shops. This area is also where you’ll find the famous maid cafés, where servers dress up as maids and serve you food and drinks. The girls on the street are promoting the more hole-in-the-wall options, which are a lot more culturally fun than the big touristy ones. (They aren’t cheap, though, as you have to buy drinks packages and pay a fee, but it’s kitschy and fun.)
Bathe in a sento
A sento is a traditional public bathhouse, typically separated by gender. The Japanese are not shy, so you’ll need to be comfortable with nudity! A budget-friendly sento will cost you under 1,000 JPY. Just note that tattoos can be frowned upon and you might be required to cover them up.
Go go-karting
Want to speed around the streets of Tokyo in a go-kart while wearing a costume? The Monkey Kart company lets you. As long as you have an international driving permit (which you can get if you have a valid driver’s license), you can take part. They’ll snap photos of you in the act too! You can book the experience here.
Shibuya, 1F, 1 Chome-27-7, +81 3-5309-2639, monkey-kart.com. Open daily 9:30am-9pm. The course will take 75 minutes and costs 16,000 JPY per person. There are multiple locations around the city.
Tokyo Itinerary: Day 3
Stroll through Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden
This gorgeous park is over 144 acres and home to some 20,000 trees. Most of the original park was destroyed in World War II during the air raids, but it was rebuilt and reopened in 1949. During spring, it’s one of the best spaces to see cherry blossoms. I love the traditional landscape garden, which has several ponds with bridges and islands. It’s a peaceful little oasis within the hustle and bustle.
11 Naitomachi, Shinjuku, +81 3-3350-0151, env.go.jp/garden/shinjukugyoen/index.html. Open Tuesday-Sunday 9am-5:30pm. Generally, advance ticket purchase is required, but note that during cherry blossom season, you can’t book tickets in advance. Admission is 500 JPY.
See Shibuya Crossing
This is quite possibly the busiest and most famous intersection in the world (some 2,500 people cross the street here every two minutes). The area is buzzing at night, with bright lights and frenzied activity — like Times Square on steroids. Make sure to visit the dog statue between Shibuya Station and the intersection (at the Hachiko Exit) — it’s a tribute to Hachiko, the loyal dog who would greet his owner at Shibuya Station on return from his daily commute. This continued until the owner passed away at work in 1925. Hachiko then visited the station daily and waited for his owner until he also passed away nearly a decade later, in 1935.
Experience a tea ceremony
No visit to Japan is complete without experiencing a traditional tea ceremony. While these are usually long and expensive experiences, there are definitely some budget-friendly options for anyone looking not to break the bank. True Japan runs ceremonies in Tokyo for 9,900 JPY per person; they last 75 minutes. Sakurai Japanese Tea Experience is another good option, located near Shibuya.
Visit a quirky café
Tokyo has all sorts of amazing, weird, and wonderful cafés: monster cafés, owl cafés, cat cafés, vampire cafés, dog cafés, religious-themed cafés, and much more! If you’re looking for something unusual to do, see what weird and quirky cafés are near you (they’re all around town, so you never have to go far to find one!). Here are some suggestions:
Kawaii Monster Café
Vampire Café
Christon Café (Christian themed)
Dog Heart (dog café)
Mipig Cafe Harajuku (pig café)
Calico (cat café)
Harry (hedgehog café)
Ninja Cafe & Bar (ninja themed)
Enjoy traditional Japanese theater
Kabuki is a traditional form of theater involving dance and drama. The costumes and makeup are heavily stylized, making for a very visual performance. The Kabuki-za, located in Ginza, is the best venue in which to see one of these incredible displays. Just keep in mind that performances are in Japanese.
4 Chome-12-15 Ginza, +81 3-3545-6800, kabuki-za.co.jp. Performances are held almost daily. Check the website for the most up-to-date schedule. Expect to pay at least 4,000 JPY if you book in advance. You can often arrive the day of and get last-minute tickets for cheaper, however.
Tokyo Itinerary: Day 4

Time to take a break and head out on a day trip for some non-urban adventures. Here are some suggestions:
See Daibutsu (the Great Buddha)
Make a day trip to Kamakura, where you can see a 13-meter (42-foot) bronze statue of Buddha. It was initially built in 1252 within a temple, but the structure was washed away — on several occasions — by storms. The statue now sits in the open air, (along with a massive pair of straw sandals that belong to the statue). You can even go inside the statue itself — there isn’t much to see, but it’s still kind of neat to be able to step into a massive statue of that size and importance.
The journey to Kamakura takes around an hour and is free with a Japan Rail Pass.
4 Chome-2-28 Hase, Kamakura, +81 467-22-0703, kotoku-in.jp. Open daily 8am-5:30pm (until 5pm during the winter). Admission is 300 JPY.
Get touristy at Tokyo Disneyland
I’m a sucker for Disney attractions! This is a fun choice for anyone traveling with children, but also for adults who just love amusement parks. Opened in 1983, it has seven themed areas to explore and is the third most visited theme park in the world (18 million each year). It has a lot of the same famous rides you’ll find at Disney World, such as Splash Mountain, the Haunted Mansion, and the nauseating Mad Tea Cup Ride. It’s best to book online in advance.
1-1 Maihama, Urayasu, +81 45-330-5211, tokyodisneyresort.jp/tdl. Open daily 8am-10pm. Admission is 7,900-10,900 JPY for adults and 6,600-9,000 JPY for children, depending on age.
Hike Mount Mitake
Located just over an hour from Tokyo is Chichibu-Tama-Kai National Park, covering 1,250 square kilometers of rolling hills, mountains, and forests. There are plenty of hiking trails, though you can also take a cable car to the top and then hike to the shrine that sits on the peak, some 930 meters (3,050 feet) above sea level. It’s a 30-minute walk to the shrine from the peak or top of the cable car. From there, you can hike for an hour to a small valley with two picturesque waterfalls or continue on to Mount Otake, which is about two hours from the summit of Mount Mitake.
Behold Mount Fuji
Located just over an hour from Tokyo and standing at an impressive 3,776 meters (12,389 feet), Mount Fuji is one of the most iconic views in the country. It is also an active stratovolcano (it last erupted in 1708) and one of the Three Holy Mountains of Japan. Covered in snow for almost half of the year, it is both a Special Place of Scenic Beauty and a UNESCO Cultural Site. In the summer, the mountain is open to hikers, who spend anywhere from 5 to 12 hours reaching the summit. Traditionally, hikers depart at night to arrive at the top for the sunrise.
If you don’t want to hike to the peak, you can simply visit on a day trip. There are buses that can take you partway up, from which you’ll be offered sweeping vistas of the surrounding area. Guided day tours from the city cost around 12,000 JPY.
Visit the Ghibli Museum
If you’re a fan of famed director Hayao Miyazaki’s work (which includes films like Spirited Away, Howl’s Moving Castle, and Princess Mononoke), then you’ll want to check out this amazing exhibition. Designed by Miyazaki himself, it is an immersive experience that any film buff will appreciate. There is also a new short film every month, only available to visitors. The museum won’t take up a whole day, but it’s not in a very central location, so you’ll need to plan accordingly.
1 Chome-1-83 Shimorenjaku, +81 570-055-777, ghibli-museum.jp. Open Wednesday-Monday 10am-6pm. Admission is 1,000 JPY for adults, with discounts available for youth and children. There are limited tickets available each day, so book in advance.
Tokyo Itinerary: Day 5

During your last day in Tokyo, the city is your oyster. There’s still plenty to do. Go shopping, explore new cafés, wander gardens, eat all the food — the possibilities are endless. Some other things I love to do include the following:
Admire the National Art Center
Opened in 2007, this museum and gallery doesn’t actually have a permanent collection but rather houses a never-ending series of temporary exhibitions, from impressionism to modern art. Check the website to see what is currently being shown.
7 Chome-22-2 Roppongi, +81 3-5777-8600, nact.jp. Open Wednesday-Monday 10am-6pm and Fridays and Saturdays until 8pm. Admission varies by exhibit.
Visit the Samurai Museum
No trip to Japan would be complete without learning about samurai. While they were known for their martial skill, there was much more to the culture than just mastering the katana (a traditional sword). The museum has some incredible displays of traditional weapons and armor, some of which you can even try on.
Kabukicho 2-25-6, +81 3-6457-6411, samuraimuseum.jp/en. Open daily 10:30am-9pm. Admission is 1,900 JPY. You can explore the museum on your own or in a group tour, which is conducted every 30 minutes. Still temporarily closed due to COVID; check the website for updates.
Watch a sumo match
Kokugikan, Japan’s most famous sumo arena, hosts tournaments three times each year. The wrestling that we see today dates to the 17th century, though its origins go back even further, and it’s still one of the most popular traditions in the country. If you’re in town at the right time, this is a must-do! Tickets sell out quickly, so act fast. You can book a ticket online here (you’ll be accompanied by a guide too, so you can learn more about the tradition as it unfolds before your eyes).
1 Chome-3-2-8 Yokoami, Sumida, +81 3-3623-5111, sumo.or.jp/kokugikan. Ticket prices vary, but expect to pay around 3,800 JPY.
Have drinks at the Park Hyatt
New York Bar is the iconic bar from Sofia Coppola’s 2003 film Lost in Translation. Located on the 52nd floor, it actually lives up to the hype. The atmosphere is classy, the drinks are great, and the view is absolutely stunning. There is live jazz every night, and while there is a cover charge (around 2,750 JPY), it’s definitely worth it!
3-7-1-2 Nishishinjuku, +81 3-5322-1234, hyatt.com. Open Sunday-Wednesday 5pm-12am and Thursday-Saturday 5pm-1am.
Peruse the Tokyo Metropolitan Teien Art Museum
Built in 1933, this small museum used to be the official residence of Prince and Princess Asaka. The prince had studied in Paris and wanted to bring Art Deco to Japan, which explains the building’s style and decorations. In 1983, the residence became a museum and is now home to a rotating series of modern art exhibitions.
5-21-9 Shirokanedai, +81 3-3443-0201, teien-art-museum.ne.jp/en. Open daily 10am-6pm. Garden admission is 200 JPY; museum admission varies depending on the current exhibition.
Promenade along the Meguro River
The Meguro River weaves almost 8 kilometers (5 miles) through Tokyo and makes for a magnificent stroll. There’s a path with a bit of green space that follows the water, so plenty of locals walk or exercise there. In the spring, you’ll be able to see a lot of cherry blossoms too. There’s also plenty of restaurants along the way to stop and eat at!
Take the Harry Potter studio tour
If you love Harry Potter, this studio tour is a must. Like the original in London, “The Making of Harry Potter” lets you walk in his footsteps and explore his amazing wizarding world. You can wander iconic sets like the Great Hall and Diagon Alley, see original props and costumes from the films, and learn how they were made. There are also sections on the newer Fantastic Beasts films. It takes about 3 hours to see it all. Just make sure to book the earliest spot in the day, as the crowds here can be huge later on. I posted more tips on Instagram if you want to learn more.
1 Chome-1-7 Kasugacho, +81 50-6862-3676, wbstudiotour.jp. Open daily 8:30am-10pm. Tickets at 6,500 JPY.
Where to Eat

Tokyo is so huge and has so many dining options, that it would be impossible to pick just two or three favorites. You can read this blog post that has all my favorite restaurants in Tokyo.
***
Tokyo is massive. You could spend a lifetime here and still not discover everything there is to see. But if you follow the itinerary and suggestions above, you’ll be able to have a fun and insightful visit and leave this sprawling capital with a nuanced perspective of what life in Tokyo is like.
Book Your Trip to Japan: Logistical Tips and Tricks
Book Your Flight
Use Skyscanner to find a cheap flight. It is my favorite search engine, because it searches websites and airlines around the globe, so you always know no stone is being left unturned.
Book Your Accommodation
You can book your hostel with Hostelworld as it has the biggest inventory and best deals. If you want to stay somewhere other than a hostel, use Booking.com, as it consistently returns the cheapest rates for guesthouses and hotels. Some of my favorite places to stay are:
Hostel Bedgasm
K’s House
Unplan Kagurazaka
For more places to stay, check out my article on my favorite hostels in Tokyo. It has a long list!
Don’t Forget Travel Insurance
Travel insurance will protect you against illness, injury, theft, and cancelations. It’s comprehensive protection in case anything goes wrong. I never go on a trip without it, as I’ve had to use it many times in the past. My favorite companies that offer the best service and value are:
Safety Wing (best for everyone)
Insure My Trip (for those 70 and over)
Medjet (for additional evacuation coverage)
Looking for the Best Companies to Save Money With?
Check out my resource page for the best companies to use when you travel. I list all the ones I use when I’m on the road. They will save you money too.
Check out the Japan Rail Pass if you’ll be traveling around the country. It comes in 7-, 14-, and 21-day passes and can save you a ton of money!

Travel,3973,"THE PERFECT 7-DAY JAPAN ITINERARY FOR FIRST-TIME VISITORS

Posted: 4/17/2024 | April 17th, 2024
Japan captured my heart from the moment I firs visited. The delicious food, the rich culture, breathtaking landscapes, vibrant history, and the very friendly and polite people – it all blew my mind.
But Japan often feels impenetrable, especially to first-time visitors. While I think Japan deserves a minimum of 10 days, I get that some people might only have a week, so I wanted to write this, my ideal seven-day itinerary for Japan for a first-time visitor.
With only a week, there’s not much you can see unless you really rush it. And I don’t think you should do that.
So this itinerary only focuses on Tokyo and Kyoto (the most popular destinations) as well as some day trips from each. If you wanted to rush things a little, you could add in Osaka (more on that at the end).
(Note: If you purchased a Japan Rail Pass, activate it on arrival. That way, you can take advantage of the free JR trains throughout the city.)

An Alternative Itinerary

  Japan Itinerary Day 1: Tokyo

With all the gorgeous shrines, palaces, and temples; unique cocktail bars; and abundant shopping, you could easily spend an entire week in Tokyo. But, with only a couple of days, you’ll want to hit the highlights:
Tsukiji and Toyosu Fish Markets
Cure your jet lag with some food! In 2018, Tokyo’s main fish market moved to Toyosu. It is now twice the size of Tsukiji (the old one), making it the largest such market in the world. Here you can eat fresh sushi for breakfast, just a few feet from where it was hauled in from the sea, while marveling at the chaotic atmosphere.
You can still head to the old market in Tsukiji to eat, shop, and wander as well. I like it a lot, because there are more food options! Food and drink tours of the Tsukiji Outer Market are available for around 15,000 JPY.
Toyosu Fish Market is open Monday-Saturday 5am-5pm, though most shops don’t open until 7am. Admission is free, but you have to pick up a visitor’s pass when you enter. Tsukiji Fish Market’s hours vary by shop (usually 5am-2pm). Admission is free.
teamLab Planets
This digital art installation is a multi-sensory and immersive experience in which you become part of the artwork, walking barefoot through the four exhibition spaces and gardens as you interact with the installations’ elements in unique ways. It’s really fun! TeamLab is generally sells out in advance, so I recommend getting your tickets online ahead of time.
Take a walking tour
Walking tours are a great way to get the lay of the land while connecting with a local guide. I always go on one or two when I arrive somewhere. Tokyo Localized offers many free tours, including a classic overview and ones of both the famed Harajuku and Shinjuku neighborhoods. Its Imperial Palace tour would be the most convenient one after teamLab.
The Imperial Palace
Formerly Edo Castle, the Imperial Palace was built in the 15th century, and some of the walls and moats from that time are still in use to this day. When the emperor moved from Kyoto to Tokyo in 1869, he took Edo for his new palace and renamed it. While you can’t go inside, it is surrounded by beautiful grounds, a moat, and a park worth wandering through. You can also see the changing-of-the-guard ceremony (though it’s relatively low-key and unassuming). Admission to the grounds is free.
Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden
This park is over 144 acres and home to some 20,000 trees. Most of the original park was destroyed in World War II but was rebuilt and reopened in 1949. During spring, it is one of the best places to see cherry blossoms. My favorite area is the landscape garden, which has several ponds with bridges and islands. It’s a peaceful oasis away from the urban hustle and bustle.
Depending on how you feel relative to your jetlag, you could fit a few more activities before you end your day. Check out this post for suggestions.
Japan Itinerary Day 2: Tokyo

I would start your second day by checking out Asakusa. You can explore the area on a guided walking tour or on your own. Go early to avoid the crowds and see the two main temples:
Senso-ji – This is Tokyo’s most popular and famous temple. Beautifully painted, it sits in a scenic spot near a pagoda and the lovely Kaminari Gate. There’s a huge statue of Kannon, the goddess of mercy, inside the main hall. It’s very busy during the day, so maybe check out the grounds in the evening.
Asakusa Shrine – This nearby Shinto shrine is much more peaceful, with fewer visitors, but with people praying, meditating, or performing traditional rituals. It was built during the Edo period (1603–1868) and survived the air raids of World War II.
Afterward, head to Ueno Park. Spanning over 133 acres, Ueno Park was established in 1873 on land formerly owned by a 17th-century Buddhist temple. It gets super busy in cherry blossom season, as there are over a thousand trees here. Throughout, you’ll find various stalls and vendors selling snacks, drinks, and souvenirs. On weekends, there are usually cultural events or festivals showcasing traditional arts, music, and dance. Four of Tokyo’s main museums are here:
Tokyo National Museum – Established in 1872 on the north end, this massive building is the oldest and largest art museum in Japan. It houses one of the world’s largest collections of art and artifacts from Asia, particularly Japan.
Tokyo Metropolitan Art Museum – This museum showcases rotating exhibitions of contemporary and traditional Japanese art.
National Museum of Nature and Science – This museum features a wide range of permanent and temporary exhibitions covering natural science and history.
Tosho-gu Shrine – This beautiful 17th-century Shinto shrine has carved gold doors and other ornate carvings. It’s worth seeing up close!
Afterward, walk down to Akihabara to explore the video game parlors, arcades, and anime shops. This very buzzy area is ground zero for all things electronic, and it’s fun to play many of the games. This is where you’ll find the famous maid cafés, where servers dress up as maids and serve you food and drinks. These range from big touristy ones to holes-in-the-wall (the girls on the street are promoting the latter, which are a lot more culturally fun). They aren’t cheap, though, as you have to buy drink packages and pay a fee, but they’re kitschy and fun.
In the evening, visit Shinjuku and then drink in Golden Gai. In Shinjuku, you’ll find a plethora of cool bars, bright lights, and tiny hole-in-the-wall eateries. Be sure to wander down Memory Lane (aka Piss Alley) for tiny izakaya joints and bars. Afterward, head over to Golden Gai, a warren of narrow alleyways with a bit of a red-light-district feel, flanked by diminutive backstreet bars. It’s quite touristy but also a lot of fun. I’ve had some wild nights here!
With Arigato Tours, you’ll learn about the neighborhood while stopping to sample Japanese classics like sushi, yakitori, and ramen. The 23,900 JPY cost includes a drink and dishes at four stops.
  Japan Itinerary Day 3: Tokyo

There’s a lot to see and do in Tokyo (I cover it all here and here)! But consider taking a day trip out of town to see some non-urban sights:
Kamakura
Here you can see a 13-meter (43-foot) bronze statue of Buddha that was built in 1252. It was initially constructed within Kotoku-in Temple, but that has since been washed away by several storms, so it now sits in the open air. Admission to enter the temple grounds is 300 JPY, while it’s 20 JPY to go inside the statue. The journey there — around an hour — is free with a Japan Rail Pass.
Tokyo Disneyland
I’m a sucker for Disney. You’ll find many of the same classic rides from Disney World here, like Splash Mountain, Big Thunder Mountain, The Haunted Mansion, and everyone’s favorite teacup ride, The Mad Tea Party. But there are several unique attractions as well, like Pooh’s Hunny Hunt and Journey to the Center of the Earth.
Ticket prices vary depending on the day and time, but full-day admission begins at 7,900 JPY for adults and 4,400-6,200 JPY for children. It’s best to book in advance.
Mount Fuji
Mount Fuji is located an hour outside of Tokyo. An active stratovolcano (which last erupted in 1708) and covered in snow for almost half of the year, it stands an impressive 3,776 meters (12,389 feet) and provides one of the most iconic views in the country. One of the Three Holy Mountains of Japan, Mount Fuji is both a Special Place of Scenic Beauty and a UNESCO Cultural Site. In the summer, the mountain is open to hikers, who take 5-12 hours to reach the summit (traditionally, they depart at night to arrive at the top for the sunrise).
If you don’t want to hike, you can simply visit on a day trip. There are buses that can take you partway up, where you’ll be offered sweeping vistas of the surrounding area. Guided day tours from the city cost around 12,000 JPY.
  
 
 
   Japan Itinerary Day 4: Kyoto

Home to 1.5 million people and nestled in the mountains, Kyoto is one of the most beautiful cities in Japan. It’s filled with traditional-style buildings, bamboo forests, countless Zen gardens, and ancient Buddhist and Shinto temples. It’s best to divide the city into half, as attractions are sort of clumped together and getting across town takes a long time. Today, you should do the western half:
Wander the Bamboo Forest
For a relaxing break, head to Arashiyama and let the dense and towering stands of bamboo envelop you. Located near the famous Tenryu-ji temple, it’s one of the most beautiful places in the entire country. It’s not that big, but there are some hidden areas to explore. Just make sure to arrive early if you want to enjoy it without the crowds (it fills up fast after sunrise).
While there, I would also recommend visiting the Okochi Sanso Garden, which (along with the home) belonged to the famous Japanese actor Denjir? ?k?chi (1898–1962). It’s not free (it’s 1,000 JPY), but it’s really nice and has some wonderful views.
Visit the Golden Pavilion
Originally built in the late 14th century as a retirement villa for the shogun (military governor), this iconic structure was later converted into a Zen Buddhist temple. The present-day edifice dates only to the 1950s, however, when a monk attempting to kill himself burned the historic original to the ground. The rebuilt temple is covered in brilliant gold leaf, symbolizing purity and enlightenment. Each of the three stories exhibits a different architectural style. Completing the scene are the serene reflecting pool and traditional Japanese gardens that contain lush foliage, manicured trees, and scenic walking paths.
1 Kinkakuji-cho, Kita-ku, Kyoto-shi, Kyoto, +81 075-461-0013, shokoku-ji.jp. Open daily 9am-5pm. Admission is 500 JPY.
Admire Ryoan-ji Temple
This is my favorite temple in Kyoto. Originally established in 1450 as a residence for a high-ranking samurai, it was soon converted into a Zen temple and is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site, with a mausoleum that houses the remains of seven emperors. Its traditional rock and sand garden is considered one of the best in the country. There’s also a teahouse where you can experience the traditional Japanese tea ceremony (chanoyu) as you overlook the Kyoyochi reflecting pool.
There are other temples in the area to check out as well:
Daitoku-ji Temple – This massive complex dating back to 1315 covers almost 60 acres. It contains several dozen temples and is a good place to see a variety of Zen gardens and architectural styles. It’s also deeply linked to the Japanese tea ceremony, as several of the country’s most noteworthy masters studied here.
Toji Temple – This is home to Japan’s tallest pagoda (five stories high). Founded in 796, just after Kyoto became the capital, it was one of only three Buddhist temples allowed in the city.
Go on a sake brewery tour
Kyoto has a sake (rice wine) brewing tradition going back 400 years and is known for some of the best in the world, due to using the area’s pure natural spring water in the brewing process. Arigato Tours offers an excellent three-hour tour of Fushimi (the brewing district) for 23,320 JPY, including stops at several breweries, a guided tour of the Gekkeikan Okura Sake Museum, and tastings.
  
 
 
 Japan Itinerary Day 5: Kyoto

Today, you’ll do the eastern part of town:
See the Fushimi Inari Shrine
This mountainside Shinto shrine, dating back to 711, is dedicated to Inari, the god of rice and prosperity. It’s known for its thousands of vibrant orange torii gates that form a network of trails leading up Mount Inari. You can hike the trails on your own while enjoying panoramic views of Kyoto below or join a guided hiking tour, on which you’ll get off the paved paths and into hidden bamboo groves. Get here as early as possible to avoid the crowds.
68 Fukakusa Yabunouchicho, +81756417331, inari.jp. Open 24/7. Admission is free.
Walk around Higashiyama
Spend an afternoon walking along the narrow streets of one of the oldest and best preserved districts on your own or on a walking tour. The traditional machiya buildings (traditional wooden townhouses) are filled with small shops selling local specialties and handicrafts, as well as restaurants and teahouses. It’s a popular area in which to participate in a tea ceremony. Another nice place to stroll in this neighborhood is the Philosopher’s Path, which follows a cherry-tree-lined canal that’s beautiful and meditative even when the blossoms aren’t in season.
Visit Kiyomizu-dera
One of a number of UNESCO sites in ancient Kyoto, Kiyomizu-dera (meaning “pure water temple”) is located in the foothills of Mount Otowa in the eastern part of the city. It’s one of the most famous temples in all of Japan. It was established in 778, but most of the existing buildings date to the 17th century. There’s not a single nail used in the construction, which becomes all the more impressive once you see how large the temple is, which is best known for its wooden terrace that juts out over the hillside. The temple’s name comes from the nearby waterfall whose waters (from which you can still drink today) are said to have wish-granting and healing powers.
1 Chome-294 Kiyomizu, +81 75-551-1234, kiyomizudera.or.jp. Open daily 6am-6pm. Admission is 400 JPY.
Explore Shorin-ji Temple
This small temple dates back to the 16th century. What makes it worth visiting is its meditation classes. You’ll get to tour the temple and then be instructed in zazen, the Japanese style of meditation. It’s a very unique experience and something that I think will add a lot of depth and nuance to your visit (especially if you’ve seen a lot of temples). Just make sure to dress comfortably.
15 Chome-795 Honmachi, +81 75-561-4311, shourin-ji.org. Open daily 10am-4pm. Admission is 800 JPY.
Wander the Nishiki Market
Nishiki Ichiba is now one of the biggest indoor markets in town. Known as “Kyoto’s Kitchen” and spanning over five blocks, it is full of vendors selling traditional dishes from the region, classic Kyoto souvenirs, and really just about anything else. There are over a hundred stalls here, many of which have been in the same family for generations. Opening hours depend on the shop but are typically from 9am to 6pm.
To dive deeper into Japanese food culture, you can take a food tour of the market. It’s the best way to learn about all the food you’ll see, as well as the market’s history.
Explore Gion
Gion, the historic geisha district, is renowned as being one of the most iconic and atmospheric areas of town. It’s known for its traditional wooden machiya houses, narrow alleyways, cobblestone streets, and preservation of geisha (known locally as geiko) culture. Lining the main street are ochayas (teahouses where geishas entertain), small shops, and many restaurants, ranging from upscale kaiseki restaurants serving traditional Kyoto cuisine to casual eateries.
To really learn more about this amazing party of town and its past, take a walking tour of Gion. You’ll learn a ton and get a lot of context. They cost around 1,800 JPY.
At night, go to the Pontocho Row, a narrow street lined with restaurants, hole-in-the-wall bars, and jazz clubs. It’s one of the more lively areas in Kyoto.
  Japan Itinerary Day 6: Nara

Many travelers visit Nara on a day trip from Kyoto. While that’s perfectly fine, I recommend spending a night. After the tourists head back to the big city in the late afternoon, you’ll see this small, charming destination empty out and feel like you have it a bit to yourself, along with the locals.
Nara was the capital of Japan in the eighth century, so there are lots of buildings and temples here that are upwards of a thousand years old (which is rare in Japan, due to the prevalence of fires and earthquakes, as well as World War II). Some things to do:
Frolic with deer – The real draw in Nara are the deer. Since the 17th century, those in and around the city have been considered sacred. You can buy crackers to feed them or just watch them stroll around carefree.
See the Buddha – Don’t miss a visit to Todai-ji, the world’s largest wooden building, home to a 16-meter (52-foot) Buddha statue. It was built in 738 and is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
Take a walking tour – This guided half-day walking tour for 11,500 JPY includes all of Nara’s highlights as well as a traditional lunch.
  Japan Itinerary Day 7: Tokyo

It’s time to wrap things up and head back to Tokyo for your flight home (or onward). If you have more time to spend, this post here will list tons of things to see and do on your last. However, one thing I would really recommend trying to do is watch a Sumo match.
Ryogoku Kokugikan, Japan’s most famous sumo wrestling arena, hosts tournaments three times each year, in January, May, and September. Tickets sell out quickly, so book online in advance. Prices vary but start around 3,200 JPY for arena seats. You can book a ticket online here (you’ll be accompanied by a guide too, so you can learn more about the tradition as it unfolds before your eyes).
To learn more about the sport in in the off-season, book a tour of a sumo stable.
  
 
 
 An Alternative Itinerary
The above itinerary, while fast, isn’t rushed. It does fit a lot in but at a pace that is slower than a lot of visitors prefer. While I always suggest traveling slowly and focusing on quality over quantity, some people prefer to cram more into their trip.
So, if you want to add another city to this itinerary you can follow this breakdown:
Days 1 & 2: Tokyo
Days 3 & 4: Kyoto
Day 5: Nara
Days 6 & 7: Osaka
Tokyo, Kyoto, and Nara are all covered above. As for Osaka, some of my favorite things to see and do:
Take a food tour
Known as “the Kitchen of Japan,” Osaka boasts a diverse culinary scene. Mouthwatering sushi and sashimi, Kobe beef and Japanese BBQ, and flavorful ramen can all be found here in abundance. Plus, there are local specialties like okonomiyaki (a savory pancake with egg and vegetables) and kushikatsu (kebab skewers). You can take a food tour for around 13,000 JPY, a ramen and gyoza cooking class for 9,500 JPY, or just wander and eat.
Osaka Castle
One of the most famous landmarks in the country, the castle was originally built in the late 16th century by Toyotomi Hideyoshi and played a pivotal role in the unification of Japan during the Sengoku period (1467-1615). Over the centuries, it has been destroyed and rebuilt multiple times due to wars, fires, and natural disasters. The current version dates to 1931. The castle is situated amid sprawling grounds and surrounded by a moat. It’s also home to a small but insightful museum and an observation deck that offers some picturesque urban views.
Dotonbori
This is arguably Osaka’s most iconic district, known for its vibrant nightlife (bars, clubs, theaters, and music venues), colorful signage, and delicious food. It’s best seen at night due to the plethora of huge neon lights and signs lining both the canal and streets, which have become symbols of Osaka’s nightlife. A guided walking tour that includes Dotonbori as well adjacent neighborhoods is 6,500 JPY.
Shitennoji Temple
This temple is one of the oldest Buddhist temples in Japan, founded in 593. The architecture is a blend of traditional Japanese and East Asian styles, featuring impressive pagodas, gates, and shrines set amid serene gardens. Stroll through the tranquil grounds, admire the beautiful architecture, and learn about the temple’s historical and cultural significance at the museum. The temple is 300 JPY to enter, the garden is 300 JPY, and the museum is 500 JPY.
  
 
 
   ***
Japan is one of my favorite countries. While it’s relatively small, it offers an amazing array of things to see and do (as well as some of the best food in the world). With seven days, you can easily see a good number of the main highlights and get a taste for the incredible history and culture. It will be a busy week, but this itinerary ensures you’ll still have some time to slow down, relax, and take in the local pace of life.
Just make sure you get a Japan Rail Pass before you go. While it’s not as cheap as it used to be, it will likely save you time and money!

Travel,2212,"HOW TO FIND THE PERFECT APARTMENT FOR VACATION RENTALS

Last Updated: 4/16/24 | April 16th, 2024
I used to hate renting apartments from websites like Airbnb or VRBO. As a solo traveler, I preferred the social atmosphere of hostels. You got to meet people, they ran activities, hosted events, and were where you were “supposed to stay” as a backpacker.
When I did want something other than a hostel, I used a hospitality network liked Couchsurfing or simply stayed with friends.
But, after a decade of life as a nomad, there are times when I like my privacy (and sometimes I also need extra space for work). While I may not use apartment rentals all the time, I stay in them often. I’ve found that they provide good value (especially if you’re traveling with multiple people), privacy, space, and a great home-like environment.
While Airbnb does contribute to overtourism, there are still lots of great hosts on the platform who provide budget-friendly accommodation to travelers looking for an alternative to hostels that won’t break the bank.
After using apartment rentals regularly for years, I wanted to create a detailed guide about how they work, how to pick the perfect apartment, and how to not get cheated.

The Best Sites to Find a Rental Apartment

  How Do Apartment Rentals Work?

Apartment rental sites allow locals to rent out an individual room, shared space (such as a couch in a living room), or entire home/apartment. The host lists their place online, posts photos, writes a description, hits publish, and, presto, they can start to make extra money with the unused space.
The booking process is like booking any other type of accommodation online. You search the database, find a place you like, create an account, and request a booking. When the owner accepts, you are sent a confirmation.
Additionally, many websites allow owners to list their place with an instant booking option, which means you don’t even have to wait for the owner to reply. You’re instantly booked in your accommodation (similar to when you book a hotel).
You’ll also be able to read reviews about the host and the apartment and see exactly what amenities are included. For example, you can see if there is a kitchen (so you can cook your own meals to save money) or if there are restrictions on noise, smoking, and pets. Maybe you need access to a washer and dryer or fast Wi-Fi. You can find all of that out in the host’s profile (or in the reviews).
Most accommodation rental sites also include a map so you can see where you’ll be located. That way, you can pick an apartment close to the attractions you want to visit, or, choose one further afield so you can have a quieter stay and get a feel for local life beyond the tourist crowds.
Who is this for?
Apartment rentals represent the space between hostels and hotels. If you are traveling on business and want the comforts of home, you probably aren’t going to stay in a hostel. But hotels may be too expensive or too impersonal for you. A rented apartment is a perfect compromise.
Or maybe, like me, you love the hostel scene but occasionally need more space and privacy. An apartment rental will be a lot quieter and more relaxing than a hostel since you won’t need to be around as many people (or as much noise). You’ll also be able to cook your own food, helping keep costs down on your trip.
Traveling with friends or a big group? This is definitely the option for you. Squeezing a bunch of people into a rental home/apartment will be much cheaper per person than a room in a hostel or hotel. Plus, you get space to spread out and relax. Dorm rooms and cramped hotels don’t give you a lot of “me” time.
Moreover, Airbnb has a new feature called “Rooms” which lets you search for listings in people’s homes or guest houses. It’s like how Airbnb used to be — people renting out extra rooms or guest houses for added cash. You always get your own room and, sometimes, a private entrance. You’ll also get to interact with your host, who can provide lots of insider tips and insight to your destination.
I’ve used Rooms a lot in the last couple of years — in LA, Rome, Paris, Nice — and, to me, as a solo traveler, it’s a much better way to travel. I highly recommend doing this as a way to combat the negative effects of these platforms (more on that below).
How to Pick the Right Airbnb

Unfortunately, as accommodation rentals have exploded into the mainstream, it’s become harder and harder to find great hosts. A lot of hosts now own multiple properties and live elsewhere. That means you often deal with property managers and never get to interact with the actual owner.
Additionally, a lot of apartments aren’t quite as nice in reality as they appear in the photos (my team had to get a refund on an apartment in Boston because it was dirty and falling apart).
In order to find suitable accommodation, I use the following criteria when looking for a place to stay on these platforms:
Do they have positive reviews? – If other people stayed there, had a good time, and found the apartment as advertised, you probably will too.
Do they have multiple listings? – This is important because many people use these sites to be property managers. They buy a bunch of apartments and then re-rent them on Airbnb. I try to avoid these places because they cause a lot of problems for the local rental market and lack the personal touch that comes when hosts rent out their own apartments.
Do they have accurate photos? – Any listing that doesn’t include a lot of (quality) photos is probably hiding something (or at the very least misrepresenting the accommodation).
Are they an active user or Superhost? – Active users are good users, so see when they last logged on. If it’s been a while, your query might go unanswered.
Is their calendar updated? – While listings only show up in a search if they are available, hosts don’t always update their calendar. If someone hasn’t updated their calendar in 30 days, I tend to skip it. There’s nothing worse than going to book a place, only for them to cancel and say, “Whoops, sorry, it’s not available!”
Are they verified? – Verified accounts are less likely to be people of suspicious quality, as the listing site has at least found some background information on them.
Have they been someone else’s guest before? – If they were someone’s guest and that went well, it’s likely that they will be reliable.
These rules are helpful guidelines, but at the end of the day, you have to go with your gut. I don’t need a listing to meet every point. I once had a host who hit only a couple of these points and she turned out to be my favorite host! And sometimes, in places without many hosts, you might have to be a little loose with this list.
But the more points a place meets, the safer I feel.
A Note on Gentrification/Legal Issues
Over the years, Airbnb and other apartment rental websites have dramatically raised the price of rents and pushed out the locals you want to interact with as people have started to buy multiple properties in order to rent them out to tourists. It’s a big problem.
In many places, like Lisbon and Venice, most locals can’t afford the price of rent anymore. And it’s not just cities. Rural areas are now becoming affected too.
There have been strong protests against Airbnb (and similar sites) in Barcelona. Throughout Europe you often see “Airbnb go home!” graffiti. Japan cracked down on Airbnb. NYC has strict laws against it now too.
Given local pushback and the issues with over tourism and the housing market, I strongly encourage you to only use Airbnb if you are renting a room in someone’s house if you can. As I mentioned above, Airbnb has a new feature called “Rooms” which allows you to easily search for rooms in people’s houses where they actually live. They are verified listings and a much better way to use the platform. It’s like how Airbnb used to be before it grew so big — people renting out extra rooms or guest houses for added cash. I highly recommend it.
However, if you can’t, try as hard as you can to make sure that the place you are renting is either a licensed B&B (if it’s only used for tourists) or someone’s house that they actually live in. This way you won’t add to any local housing issues!
Help end overtourism. You have the power. Don’t displace the people you want to visit!
Are These Sites Safe?

These sites run on trust. All these companies try to verify both buyer and seller to ensure no one ends up robbing anyone else, but you sometimes hear reports of sex parties, robberies, or creepy hosts.
However, apartment rental companies do provide a window that allows you to get your money back if you get a place that’s not as advertised. Just call their 24-hour hotline and they will set you up somewhere else (you can also reach out on social media to get the conversation started). They also hold your money in escrow so that if the place isn’t as advertised, you’ll get your money back. You never hand it over directly to the host.
All types of accommodations have risks (cleaners can steal from hotel rooms, dorm mates can take clothes from hostels, Couchsurfing hosts can get creepy), which is why these rules are important. I don’t think apartment rentals are any less safe than your other options, and the benefits greatly outweigh the perceived danger.
Moreover, hosts rely on reviews much more so than traditional accommodation. That means, as a guest, you have a lot of power should there be a problem.
The Best Sites to Find a Rental Apartment
While Airbnb reigns supreme, there are actually several websites you can use to find rental accommodation while you travel:
Airbnb
House Trip
Vrbo
Campspace (for finding private campsites)
Another option for long-term travelers is house sitting and pet sitting. In exchange for looking after someone’s property or pet while they travel, you get access to free accommodation. It’s a great option for slow/long-term travelers looking to stay in one location for longer periods of time. Check out this post to learn more about it!
***
If I’m traveling by myself, I tend to stay in a hostel dorm or use hotel points, but I use Airbnb pretty much every time I travel with friends.
And many of the hosts have really made a difference. There was the host in Curaçao who picked me up from the airport (and drove me around the island), the host in Galway who took me out for drinks (he turned out to be a reader!), and the French hosts who left me a cute hand-drawn map and a bottle of wine. You won’t find such personal service at hotels.
Apartment rentals, when done right, are safe, affordable, and help you have a more authentic experience. Use the tips above and try one on your next trip. You’ll save money, get away from the tourists, and have a better trip!

Travel,1554,"THE 6 BEST HOTELS IN FLORENCE

Posted: 4/11/24 | April 11th, 2024
Florence is one of the most beautiful cities in Italy. Its entire historic center is a picturesque UNESCO World Heritage Site, there’s art everywhere, and the food here is insanely delicious.
I’ve been visiting the city off and on for the past sixteen years and am always blown away by how gorgeous it is. Visiting here feels like you’ve stepped back in time.
Since Florence is such a popular destination, there are tons of hotels here. Some of them are great, and some of them not so great. Over the years, I’ve stayed in a lot of different hotels in the city. To help you plan your visit, here’s my list of the best hotels in Florence:
1. Hotel Alba Palace

Located next to the cloisters of the Santa Maria Novella Basilica, this beautiful three-star hotel is decorated in a traditional Florentine style. Each room is unique, with soft yellow walls and historic features that include antique terracotta floors, arched ceilings, and exposed brick walls. The complimentary breakfast is fantastic, with a lot of variety (such as pastries, yogurt, cakes, cold cuts, and espresso drinks). Best of all, it’s served in a tranquil atrium with a glass ceiling.
All rooms have a flatscreen TV, minibar, desk, Nespresso machine, hairdryer, and safe. The beds are comfy and the windows are soundproofed, so you’ll be able to sleep well here. While the bathrooms are a bit small, there’s excellent water pressure in the showers, a bidet, towel warming racks, and complimentary toiletries. In addition to classic rooms with a double bed, there are also cheaper rooms with single beds for solo travelers. Overall, it’s an affordable choice in one of the better neighborhoods in the city.
Book here!

  2. Hotel Davanzati

This cozy three-star hotel in the heart of the historic center (just a block from Ponte Vecchio) offers a lot of value. The free continental breakfast is quite varied, with fresh fruit, yogurt, cereals, pastries, and cold cuts. There are also social hours with complimentary drinks and snacks, including afternoon tea and cakes, and an aperitivo with Prosecco and savory bites.
The rooms are decorated with pastel-colored walls that have historic drawings and maps on them. All rooms are pretty spacious and feature comfy beds, a desk, flatscreen TV, and a wardrobe. The bathrooms are large too and have heated towel racks as well as showers with excellent water pressure. The staff really go out of their way to help with anything you need too. (Just be aware that there is no elevator, so it’s not the best choice for those with mobility issues.)
Book here!

  3. The Place Firenze

This five-star hotel is located right on Piazza Santa Maria Novella in a restored 17th-century building. The hotel has an outdoor terrace right on the piazza, offering Tuscan specialties, drinks, and an excellent breakfast spread in the morning (it’s included in your stay). There’s also a small rooftop with incredible views and free access to a gym just a couple of minutes away.
An award-winning boutique property (there are just 20 rooms here), all the rooms are individually decorated in pastel colors, with unique artwork, chandeliers, and bespoke furniture. There’s lots of natural light in the rooms too, and amenities include a minibar (with complimentary soft drinks and snacks), flatscreen TV, and spacious desk. The elegant marble bathrooms have a bidet, complimentary luxury toiletries, plush bathrobes, and slippers. The showers have good pressure, and some rooms have separate deep tubs too. You’ll want for nothing here, though if you do, the exceptionally helpful staff will go out of their way to get it for you. It’s the most exclusive hotel in the city and the place to stay if you’re looking to splurge in Florence.
Book here!

  4. La Maison du Sage

This three-star hotel is tucked just off Piazza di Santa Croce in the heart of the lively Santa Croce neighborhood. A boutique property, the entire place is eclectically designed with interesting artwork and walls painted with fun pastel colors. I especially love all the cool wooden Art Deco furniture. There’s also an excellent breakfast buffet featuring pastries, juice, eggs, ham, cheese, and fresh fruit.
The spacious rooms are filled with natural light and have the same chic design as the rest of the hotel. All rooms have hardwood or parquet floors and include a minibar, flatscreen satellite TV, Nespresso coffee machine, and kettle for tea. The bathrooms are large and feature walk-in rainfall showers (some with a separate soaking tub), heated towel racks, and a bidet. This is a great choice for travelers who want to stay close to Centro Storico but want a more local experience. It’s a really nice property that offers outsized value for the price.
Book here!

  5. Hotel Palazzo Guadagni

This three-star hotel is set in a 16th-century Florentine palace right on Piazza Santo Spirito in the trendy Santo Spirito neighborhood. The smartly decorated rooms retain many of the features from their aristocratic days, such as high ceilings, large windows, antique furniture, frescoed ceilings, and fireplaces. In-room amenities include a minibar, flatscreen TV, and a safe. The large and tiled bathrooms offer heated towel racks, a bidet, fluffy bathrobes, and slippers.
But my favorite part of this hotel is the rooftop terrace and its stunning views over the city. In the mornings, they offer a fantastic complimentary breakfast spread, and at night you can enjoy the sun setting over the red rooftops with a drink in hand. It feels much more luxurious than your typical three-star hotel here. I think this is the perfect choice for intrepid travelers who want to experience local Florentine life on the other side of the Arno River.
Book here!

  6. Hotel Bernini Palace

This five-star hotel is set in a 15th-century building and, true to its name, it feels like you’re staying in a palace here. The grand lobby is decorated in fusion of Italian and Moroccan styles, featuring arched ceilings and doorways. I really like that the complimentary breakfast buffet is served in a room with a lot of history (Italian heads of Parliament used to meet here) and a beautiful, frescoed ceiling.
The elegant rooms feature wood-beamed ceilings, parquet or terracotta floors, glass chandeliers, antique furnishings, and comfy beds with gilded headboards. The rooms are spacious and have all the amenities you’d expect from a hotel of this caliber, including minibars, flatscreen TVs, desks, and air conditioning. The marble bathrooms are huge too and include a bidet, plush bathrobes and slippers, and a hairdryer. This is the best place to stay for luxury in the heart of Florence (it’s just a five-minute walk to the Duomo).

With its iconic Renaissance architecture, picturesque streets, world-class museums, and incredible food, Florence is one of my favorite cities in Italy. I’ve been a handful of times over the years and it never disappoints.
It’s also a compact and easily walkable city, so nothing is too far from anything else. That said, each neighborhood has its own unique feel and accommodation options. For that reason, it’s a good idea to choose a neighborhood that best suits your travel style and budget.
To help you do just that, here’s my list of the best neighborhoods in Florence:

 Where to Stay for First-Time Visitors: Centro Storico

This is Florence’s emblematic historic center, a UNESCO World Heritage Site and home to the iconic Duomo (cathedral), world-class art at the Uffizi Gallery, and bustling plazas like Piazza della Signoria. Stay here to be in the center of it all, with the main attractions just steps away.
It’s also a good neighborhood if you’re looking to do some shopping. For luxury, head to Via de’ Tornabuoni, where all the high-end designers have storefronts, while Ponte Vecchio is the place to go if you’re in the market for jewelry.
You’ll also have the largest array of accommodation options here. Just keep in mind that it gets incredibly crowded in the summer, and prices skyrocket accordingly.
Best places to stay in Centro Storico:
BUDGET: Emerald Palace – Offering affordable private rooms and dorms (including female-only dorms), Emerald Palace is an excellent no-frills option for budget travelers who don’t want to compromise on location. The rooms are spacious, with beautiful painted ceilings and terracotta floors, and everything (including the shared bathrooms) is kept sparkling clean. While there aren’t a ton of amenities here (though there is breakfast and a guest kitchen), it’s a friendly and affordable choice in the heart of the historic center.
MIDRANGE: Hotel Davanzati – This cozy three-star hotel offers a lot of value, with a complimentary continental breakfast, afternoon tea, and an aperitivo hour with prosecco. The rooms are a bit dated in their décor, but they are spacious, with comfy beds, a desk, a flatscreen TV, and a wardrobe. The bathrooms are large too and have heated towel racks, as well as nice showers with excellent water pressure. The staff really go out of their way to help with anything you need too.
LUXURY: Hotel Bernini Palace – It feels like you’re staying in a palace in this five-star hotel, set in a 15th-century building. The elegant rooms are spacious and feature wood-beamed ceilings, parquet or terracotta floors, glass chandeliers, antique furnishings, and plush beds with gilded headboards. They also have all the amenities you’d expect from a hotel of this caliber, including minibars, flatscreen TVs, desks, and air conditioning. There’s a complimentary breakfast buffet too, served in a room with a frescoed ceiling that used to be a meeting place for members of Italy’s parliament!
  Where to Stay for Budget Travelers: Santa Maria Novella

Santa Maria Novella is a large area west of Centro Storico. It surrounds a basilica, piazza, and train station, all with the same name as the neighborhood. The area is great for budget-conscious travelers who appreciate the convenience of being both close to the historic center and the train station for onward travel. It’s also a good area for backpackers that want a traditional hostel experience, as all the best hostels in Florence are here.
The area around Piazza Santa Maria Novella and south toward the river is a bit more upscale, while most hostels are concentrated just to the northeast of the train station. Just avoid staying right next to the train station, as it’s not the not the nicest section of the neighborhood.
Best places to stay in Santa Maria Novella:
BUDGET: Ostello Bello Firenze – This lively hostel has a cozy common room, guest kitchen, and bar where all guests get a free welcome drink. There’s also a rooftop terrace and lots of social events throughout the week (such as live music or parties). It’s a really easy hostel to meet people in. Plus, all dorm rooms have ensuite bathrooms and lockers and are filled with lots of natural light. It’s one of the best hostels in town.
MIDRANGE: Hotel Alba Palace – This beautiful three-star hotel is decorated in a traditional Florentine style. Each room is unique, with historic features that include antique terracotta floors, arched ceilings, and exposed brick walls. The fantastic complimentary breakfast is served in a tranquil atrium with a glass ceiling. All rooms have a flatscreen TV, minibar, desk, Nespresso machine, hairdryer, and safe. While the bathrooms are small, there’s great water pressure in the showers. There are even rooms with a twin bed in case you’re a solo traveler looking to save money but don’t want to stay in a hostel.
LUXURY: The Place Firenze – This five-star hotel is located right on Piazza Santa Maria Novella in a restored 17th-century building. All the rooms in this award-winning boutique property are decorated in pastel colors, with unique artwork, chandeliers, bespoke furniture, and elegant marble bathrooms. Each soundproofed room comes with a flatscreen TV, minibar, and a desk. There’s also a complimentary breakfast on the hotel’s outdoor terrace on the piazza, and a rooftop with incredible views, not to mention exceptionally helpful staff.
  Where to Stay for Food and Nightlife: Santa Croce

The Santa Croce neighborhood is located just a ten-minute walk to the east of Centro Storico but is much less frequented by tourists. Along with its beautiful basilica and lively square, it’s filled with restaurants, cafés, and boutiques. It’s especially renowned for its vibrant nightlife, with all varieties of bars, pubs, and clubs centered around the main square and on Via de’ Benci.
If you’re after good food and a more low-key atmosphere, head to Sant’Ambrogio, a micro-neighborhood that surrounds the market of the same name.
Best places to stay in Santa Croce:
BUDGET: B&B Hotel Firenze City Center – This bed-and-breakfast is your best choice for budget-friendly accommodation in Santa Croce. It features simple, light-filled rooms with a desk and flatscreen TV. The bathrooms have a bidet, complimentary toiletries, and a hairdryer. There’s a breakfast buffet in the mornings too (9.50 EUR) with croissants, cakes, muffins, cereals, yoghurt, and eggs.
MIDRANGE: La Maison du Sage – This four-star hotel is eclectically designed, with Art Deco furniture, hardwood floors, and brightly colored walls. The rooms are spacious, filled with natural light, and include a minibar, flatscreen satellite TV, Nespresso coffee machine, and kettle for tea. The bathrooms are sleekly designed and spacious, with a bidet and a walk-in shower (some rooms have separate tubs). There’s also an excellent breakfast buffet boasting pastries, juice, eggs, ham, cheese, and fresh fruit.
LUXURY: Relais Santa Croce, by Baglioni Hotels – This five-star hotel is set in an 18th-century building that retains its historic décor (including frescoed ceilings and hardwood floors). Each spacious guestroom contains different historic elements, such as a four-poster bed or exposed beams. All of the airy rooms have a desk, flatscreen TV, minibar, and large bathroom with a bidet, bathrobes, and complimentary bath products. There’s also a tasty free breakfast each morning with lots of variety.
  Where to Stay for Feeling like a Local: Oltrarno

Located on the south side of the Arno River (the name literally means “across the Arno”), Oltrarno is known for its artisan workshops, antique stores, and more laid-back atmosphere. There are several micro-neighborhoods here, but trendy Santo Spirito is best for most visitors, as it’s just a short walk to the center of town.
This area is not without its own attractions though, home to both Pitti Palace and the whimsical Boboli Gardens. Overall, Oltrarno is best for travelers looking for a more authentic and local experience away from the tourist crowds.
Best places to stay in Oltrarno:
BUDGET: “il Pitti” Soggiorno – There aren’t any hostels here (you’ll mostly find midrange accommodation in this area), but this hotel directly across the street from Pitti Palace offers affordable and comfy private rooms with ensuite or shared bathrooms. The rooms are painted in cheery pastel colors and have lots of natural light, as well as parquet floors. The décor is a bit dated, but all rooms have a desk, wardrobe, electric kettle, and bathroom with a rainfall shower and bidet. It’s a great no-frills option for budget travelers that want to stay in a quieter neighborhood.
MIDRANGE: Hotel Palazzo Guadagni – Situated in a 16th-century Florentine palace on a quiet square, this three-star hotel boasts elegantly decorated rooms with frescoed ceilings, large windows, antique furniture, and fireplaces. In-room amenities include a minibar, flatscreen TV, safe, and tiled bathroom with a heated towel rack, a bidet, fluffy bathrobes, and slippers. There’s also a fantastic complimentary breakfast and a rooftop with stunning views over the city. I think the value for what you get here is fantastic. It feels much more luxurious than your typical three-star hotel.
LUXURY: Hotel Lungarno – Lungarno Collection – Located just steps from Ponte Vecchio bridge leading into Centro Storico, this gorgeous five-star hotel features original modern art throughout. The spacious, light-filled rooms have Italian white marble bathrooms with a bidet and luxury toiletries, and all rooms have a desk, a flatscreen TV, a minibar, and sound-proofed walls. There’s also a Michelin-starred restaurant and an excellent breakfast spread here.

Posted: 4/8/2024 | April 8th, 2024
TravelCon is back! In 2022, after five years (through a pandemic), I ended TravelCon. However, my friends at FinCon offered to run it (thus reducing my workload) so we brought it back! If you’re media or PR in the travel industry, this is the best industry event for you to attend!
TravelCon is a three-day travel media event that focuses on helping you improve your craft, learn new business skills, network with your peers, and connect you with all the awesome brands and tourism boards that attend!
This year, TravelCon will be May 15-17th in Portland, Oregon and will feature pre- and post-event trips; meet-ups; dinner parties; and in-depth, actionable talks. The goal is to help travel creators go pro by turning their passion into a profession and then scale their online business.
At TravelCon, you can:
Improve your craft in the four major areas of travel: video, photography, writing, and blogging
Learn what’s hot, what works, and what doesn’t in the industry
Keep current on the best practices in digital travel publishing

Meet destinations and travel brands
Learn from experts outside the travel industry

Have a ton of fun!!!
  What can you expect this year?

“Go Pro” sessions will empower part-time creators to go full-time with topics such as:
Expanding your reach using advanced SEO, ads, & email marketing.
Discovering creator tools and services to streamline your workflow.
Diversifying how you monetize your content, including affiliate marketing and collaborations.
Building effective partnerships with CVBs, DMOs, travel boards, travel brands, and local agencies.

Diversifying your revenue streams, including product development, courses, or membership communities.
Maintaining balance to avoiding burnout as a full-time creator and digital nomad.
Leveraging AI & other emerging tech for content creation & business growth.

Travel,2203,"HOW TO PLAN A TRIP: A MONTH-BY-MONTH GUIDE

Posted: 4/2/2024 | April 2nd, 2024
Trip planning can be a daunting task. Flights, insurance, gear, itineraries, accommodation, and so much more all need to be considered and sorted out before you go.
It’s easy to get overwhelmed, especially when you haven’t done something like this before.
After over close to twenty years of traveling the world, I’ve planned countless trips and vacations for myself, friends, and family, even group tours. In the beginning, it was trial by fire. I learned a lot of lessons the hard way. However, that helped me develop an efficient checklist that ensures I don’t miss anything important during the trip-planning process.
One big question I get asked a lot is when to start planning. To answer that question, this post breaks the planning process down into month-by-month steps so you can plan your next trip with ease.
Here’s how to plan a trip:
Table of Contents
12 Months Out: Decide on Your Destination(s)
12 Months Out: Start Collecting Points & Miles
8 Months Out: Visa Requirements, Passports, and Vaccines
4-6 Months Out: Book Your Flight
3-4 Months Out: Book Your Accommodation
2 Months Out: Plan Your Activities
1 Month Out: Get Travel Insurance
7 days out: Pack!
12 Months Out: Decide on Your Destination(s)

A lot of people talk vaguely about travel: they never say where they are going, just that they are going. They might talk about it for years before actually departing (if they go at all). But it’s much easier to reach and plan for the goal of “I am going to Paris for two weeks this summer” than “I’m going somewhere.”
If you already have a dream destination in mind, great! If not, here are some posts to help you get started:
11 Cheap Places to Visit on the US Dollar
10 Places to Travel on a Budget
The Best Tropical Islands in the World
My Favorite Cities in the World
My 31 Favorite Places to Visit in the USA
But, this far out, the real thing you want to do is start saving money and figuring out your costs. Accommodation and flights are the obvious ones, but how much do restaurants, attractions, and other activities cost? Knowing these costs will allow you accurately estimate how much money you’ll need. Here is how to research costs:
Buy a guidebook
Check out my free travel guides (we break down all costs for each destination)
Skim the cost of living on Numbeo.com
Google prices for major activities you want to do, such as scuba diving, winery tours, etc. (Get Your Guide is a good place to start)
Use Skyscanner or Google Flights for flight prices and sign up for alerts to get emails if the price changes
Use Discover Cars to price out (and book) a rental car if you need one
Use Booking.com and Hostelworld to research accommodation costs
That may seem like a lot but you just want to get a general idea of how much you need to save. You can head to this page to see all my articles on how to save money for your trip.
12 Months Out: Start Collecting Points & Miles

While you’re working to save money, get a travel credit card so you can earn miles and points for free flights and hotel stays. It’s what has kept my costs down and me on the road for so many years.
These days, most cards have welcome offers of 60,000-80,000 points (some can be as high as 100,000) when you meet their minimum spending requirement (generally $2,000-5,000 USD within a 3–6-month time frame). That’s enough miles for a free round-trip economy flight to Europe from the East Coast of North America.
For more information on this subject, check out these posts:
Points & Miles 101: A Beginner’s Guide
How to Pick the Best Travel Credit Card
My Favorite Travel Credit Cards

The Ultimate Guide to Points & Miles
How to Collect Points & Miles in Canada
In addition, get a fee-free ATM card. I use Charles Schwab, but there are lots of other banks that don’t charge ATM fees (don’t forget to check your local banks and credit unions too). Here’s how you can avoid bank fees while traveling.
8 Months Out: Visa Requirements, Passports, and Vaccines
While you likely won’t need a visa to your desired destination, you should still check to make sure. If you’re a US citizen, use the State Department’s search tool to learn about your destination’s entry requirements. (Canadians can use this search tool.)
Additionally, make sure that your passport is valid for at least six months after your trip ends. Many countries require this for entry. Passport application and renewal wait times can be long (the standard is 6-8 weeks in the US), so do this as soon as possible.
Also, research if you need any vaccines for your trip as many countries require vaccines to enter (and I don’t mean COVID). You can learn more about country requirements and recommendations at the CDC’s website. They can help you find a clinic near you as well (if you’re in the US).
4-6 Months Out: Book Your Flight

The best time to book your flight is generally around 3-4 months before your departure, or 5-6 months before if you are going during a destination’s peak season. This isn’t a hard-and-fast rule, though, so use it as a guide.
Here are two articles on how to score a cheap flight:
How to Always Find Cheap Flights
5 Steps to Booking a Cheap Flight
If you’ve signed up for a travel credit card and received your sign-up bonus, use your miles to book your flight and/or hotel. The further out you book, the more availability there will be. Use tools like Point.me and Awayz to help you find the best redemptions on your points (for flights and hotels, respectively).
But even if you aren’t using miles or didn’t find a cheap flight deal, there are still many ways to avoid being the person on the flight who paid the most for their ticket. My two favorite sites for finding cheap airfare are Skyscanner and Google Flights.
  3-4 Months Out: Book Your Accommodation

If you’re traveling for under two weeks and have a set schedule, book accommodation for the duration of your trip. If you’re visiting during the high season, it’s also a good idea to book everything in advance. For trips longer than two weeks, I suggest booking only the first couple of nights of your trip. Once there, you may end up wanting to change your plans based on insider advice from other travelers and/or hotel/hostel staff. I prefer having flexibility, so I always just book a few nights and go from there.
Here are my go-to sites when it comes to finding the best deals on accommodation:
Hostelworld – Hostelworld has the largest selection of hostels and is my go-to site for finding affordable hostels.
Booking.com – Booking.com is the best overall platform for finding budget hotels and guesthouses.
Agoda – Agoda has the best results if you’re heading to Asia (though it sometimes has good US deals too).
I recommend checking the cancelation policy of wherever you book. I like having the flexibility to cancel if something comes up.
If you’re on a tight budget or you want to connect with more locals during your travels, consider joining platforms like Couchsurfing or BeWelcome. These communities allow travelers to stay with residents for free as a sort of cultural exchange.
Long-term travelers can also try housesitting or WWOOFing as well, as they both offer free accommodation (in exchange for pet sitting or farm work, respectively).
2 Months Out: Plan Your Activities
Now it’s time for the fun part of travel planning! That means reading books about your destination, learning general travel tips, connecting with online communities, and pre-booking any necessary activities.
Pre-booking ensures you don’t miss out on things that you really want to do on your trip. If you’re going to a popular destination, tours and activities fill up quickly, and if you’re going to a smaller place, activities or tours might only run on certain days and have limited availability.
Either way, Get Your Guide the best place to search for and pre-book activities, tours, and tickets. Local tour operators and attractions can list their offerings on this online marketplace, so you can find tons of stuff here, from food tours to museum tickets with skip-the-line entry.
1 Month Out: Get Travel Insurance
Get travel insurance. That way, these purchases are protected should something happen that makes you cancel your trip.
A lot of people think, “I’m healthy. I don’t need travel insurance.” But travel insurance is much more than just medical protection. It covers you when your camera breaks, your flight is canceled, a family member dies and you have to come home, or something gets stolen. (That’s why you’ll also want to familiarize yourself with any common travel scams to look out for, as well as how to conduct yourself in order to blend in to avoid looking like a target for petty theft.)
Yes, it’s an added expense. But it’s always better to be safe than sorry. I never leave home without it, because I’ve seen firsthand just what can happen on the road.
I never thought I would pop my eardrum while I was scuba diving in Thailand, break my camera in Italy, or get knifed in Colombia.
Unfortunately, bad things can happen when you’re traveling. True, these events are few and far between. But they can cost tens of thousands of dollars. If you’re not prepared to pay out of pocket, buy travel insurance.
Here are some posts on travel insurance to get you started:

The Best Travel Insurance for Seniors
I never leave home without travel insurance. You shouldn’t either.
7 days out: Pack!

Your trip is almost here, and it’s time to pack! It can be tempting to want to bring everything with you “just in case.” But when it comes to travel, less is more. While what you pack will depend on where you are going, remember that you don’t need to take everything you own. You can buy things you need and do laundry on the road. At the end of the day, you have to carry everything you bring. So bring less!
I travel with a 45L REI bag and then a smaller day bag. Here’s my suggested packing list to help you take just the right amount of stuff and avoid overpacking (here’s a list for female travelers).
Additionally, bring any prescriptions you need for the duration of your trip. Try not to rely on filling those abroad (though bring a prescription and doctor’s note just in case).
***
With everything taken care of, it’s time to go on your trip and have fun! Make a list of last-minute items you need to pack the day of (your toothbrush, glasses, phone charger, etc.) and check in online beforehand (you can do so 24 hours in advance). (If you’ve got lounge access through a premium travel rewards card, you might find yourself looking forward to getting to the airport early.)
If you’re feeling nervous, don’t worry. That’s perfectly normal. Feeling anxious or unsure is something every traveler experiences. But you’ve made it this far. Trust your planning and follow your instincts. You’re about to have the trip of a lifetime.
Book Your Trip: Logistical Tips and Tricks

Travel,2950,"13 ICELAND ROAD TRIP TIPS: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW BEFORE YOU GO

Posted: 4/2/24 | April 2nd, 2024
Iceland is a magical country. It just feels out of this world, like you’re on another planet. The rugged volcanoes and black-sand beaches give the island a desolate but striking appearance. If you ask me, it’s right up there with New Zealand and Norway in terms of the most beautiful countries in the world.
And, just like both of those destinations, it’s an amazing place to take a road trip.
Thanks to its stunning natural beauty, safety, and ease of transportation, Iceland has become a popular destination for solo travelers and first-time road trippers. Yes, it can be expensive, but it has so much to see and do, including tons of amazing hikes and waterfalls that are free to enjoy. You don’t need to break the bank here.
Having been to Iceland a handful of times over the years, I think taking a road trip is the best way to explore the country. So, to ensure you save time and money and stay safe during your trip, here are my top 13 Iceland road-trip tips:

  1. Make sure you have car insurance
I never leave home without travel insurance. And I never rent a car without comprehensive auto insurance either.
In most destinations, this might seem like overkill. I mean, how often do you actually use your car insurance?
In Iceland, however, the weather changes often — and drastically.
Rain and snow are common, and gravel and sand often damage windows. But the real threat most drivers aren’t prepared for is the wind. The gusts here are so strong that car doors are regularly ripped off their hinges (every time I’ve rented a car here, the company has reminded me of this).
Combine that with winding, narrow roads and an abundance of active volcanoes, and you’ve got yourself a recipe for car trouble.
That’s why I always recommend travelers have comprehensive car rental coverage when they visit Iceland. Because it’s much better to be safe than sorry here!
When it comes to renting a car, I recommend Discover Cars. When you book, it’s super easy to add car insurance onto your purchase with the click of a button. They make it clear what is covered and how much it costs.

  2. Rent the right vehicle
It’s easy to rent a car in Iceland. You don’t need an International Driving Permit if you have a valid license using Latin letters with a license number, photograph, and expiration date. That means Americans, Canadians, Australians, Brits, and New Zealanders can all rent a car here with their regular license.
When renting a vehicle in Iceland, you have three main choices:
A car
A 4×4 (4WD)
A van/RV
If you’re just planning to see the main sights while sleeping in hostels, hotels, and/or Airbnbs, a regular car will do the trick. It’s the cheapest option too.
If you want to explore the rugged interior (known as the Highlands), a 4×4 is required, since the roads there are often unpaved, gravel ones called “F-roads,” which can only be traversed by 4×4 vehicles (if you drive a regular car on them, your insurance coverage will be void).
Your final choice is a campervan/RV. These are for travelers who want to sleep in their vehicle as they travel. They are the most expensive option, but you’ll save money on accommodation, so it kind of balances out.
Just keep in mind that standard transmissions are the norm here, so reserve an automatic-transmission vehicle if that’s a requirement for you.
(Note: No matter what type of vehicle you have, never drive off-road. It is highly illegal due to the fragility of Iceland’s ecosystem. Not only does off-roading damage this beautiful environment, but you could face stiff fines if caught.)
  3. Download the right apps
Everyone road-tripping around Iceland should have the following apps downloaded to or websites bookmarked on their phone:
Google Translate – While English is widely spoken, the app can be helpful for reading signs and directions. Just make sure to download Icelandic for offline use so that you can still translate things even without mobile data.
Google Maps – The best app for looking up directions. Make sure to download your maps so you have them for offline use.
Safetravel.is – This app shares weather alerts, road closure information, and more. It’s good to have so you can be kept up to date should inclement weather or emergencies arise.
Vedur.is – This is the best weather app for Iceland.
Samferda – This website is great for finding passengers if you want to share a ride with someone. (If you’re a passenger and need a ride, you can post here too.) Another helpful site for finding passengers is Couchsurfing.
Check the international policies and charges on your phone plan before leaving, so as to avoid unexpected charges when using these apps and/or websites. If you want to stay connected with unlimited data on your trip, get an eSIM.
  4. Bring a paper map
Whenever I go on a road trip, I always bring a paper map. I know, Google Maps is easy and free, and mobile data coverage in Iceland is reliable. But it’s better to be safe than sorry. You never know when your phone is going to break, if your signal will be lost, or there will be an emergency.
Give yourself peace of mind: bring a paper road map with you, and just leave it in the glove box. You likely won’t need it, but if you do, you’ll be glad you have it!
  5. Choose your direction wisely
The vast majority of travelers road-tripping through Iceland drive the Ring Road (aka Route 1, the country’s main highway) counterclockwise. This allows you to start with the famous Golden Circle and then head toward popular sights like the Skógafoss and Seljalandsfoss waterfalls, the Sólheimasandur crash site, the glacier lagoon, and more. If you only have a few days to explore, this is the best direction to choose. If it’s your first-time visiting Iceland, this is the direction I suggest.
However, if you want to be contrarian or you want to get off the beaten path, head clockwise. There are still some sights you can visit to kick things off, such as the postcard-perfect Mount Kirkjufell and the rugged Snæfellsnes Peninsula.
If you really want to get off the beaten path and beat the crowds, head to the Westfjords. Only a fraction of travelers come here, so it’s home to some of the most unspoiled landscapes in the country. It was also the highlight of all my time in Iceland.
  6. Avoid the F-roads (if you have a car)
As mentioned above, F-roads are rugged, unpaved routes that generally lead off the main Ring Road into the interior. Driving on these roads requires a 4×4 (4WD). If you have a regular car, you won’t be permitted to drive on them. You will void your insurance coverage while also risking blowing a tire or damaging the car. It’s not worth it!
  7. Check the weather often
I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: the weather in Iceland changes rapidly. For that reason, you’ll want to keep an eye on the forecast. While driving in wind or rain might not be an issue, if you’re planning to get out and hike or visit some of the waterfalls, you’ll want to make sure you’re prepared for the weather. The Vedur.is app (mentioned above) is a must.
No matter what time of year you visit, bring rain gear (including a hat), waterproof footwear, and a sweater. Even in the summer, Iceland is rarely hot, and rain isn’t uncommon either. Prepare accordingly so your trip isn’t ruined (especially if you plan on hiking).
  8. Only pull over where there is space
You are going to be tempted to stop your car often to take photos. And I mean really often. Not only are the main sights in Iceland awe-inspiring, but the average sights are stunning too. You’ll come across random vistas and waterfalls, craggy moss-covered hills, black-sand beaches, and so much more.
It will be tempting to pull over to get out and take photos, but do so with caution. Try to pull off the road only at designated stops or where there is room to do so without impeding traffic. While the Ring Road isn’t a superhighway, it is a busy route with regular traffic in both directions. Don’t endanger yourself or others for a photo. Stick to designated stopping areas.
  
 
 
 9. Keep an eye on your gas tank
Once you leave the busier part of the island around Reykjavik, gas stations become few and far between. For that reason, you’ll want to fill up when you can. Don’t just wait until you have a quarter tank, as you might run out of gas before you get to the next station.
While you can generally look up where gas stations are via Google Maps, I always make sure to top up when I can. The peace of mind is worth it. You’ll also be covered in case you get delayed or change your travel plans at the last minute.
  10. Don’t rush
A lot of people think that, because Iceland is small, you can see the sights in just a matter of days.
You can’t.
If you’re looking to drive the entire Ring Road, plan for at least 10-14 days. While you can do it in less, you will be rushed and will spend more time driving than I’d recommend. (If you just want to see the main highlights in the south and east, 5-7 days is sufficient.)
I prefer quality over quantity, so I always suggest travelers slow down and really soak in the sights. You won’t regret it.
If you’re looking for recommended itineraries, this post breaks down all my suggestions for different time frames, all the way up to an entire month.
  11. Avoid the summer (and also the winter)
Iceland suffers from success. The country is swamped by travelers during the summer, between late June and early August, as that is when the weather is the warmest and the days are the longest. While “busy” in Iceland is a far cry from “busy” in cities like Barcelona or Venice, it can still be crowded around Reykjavik and the sights closest to the city.
For that reason, I suggest visiting in the shoulder season. The weather is still warm and there will be far fewer people. Everything will be a little cheaper too.
If you are set on going in the summer, I’d suggest heading off to the Westfjords. It’s the least-visited area of the country and offers some of the most untamed and beautiful landscapes in Iceland.
Additionally, I suggest avoiding winter visits too if you plan on driving. Road conditions are less than ideal, and snowstorms are frequent. Unless you have lots of experience with winter driving, skip that season. (You can definitely do a winter visit to see the northern lights, I just wouldn’t rent a car for that.)
Personally, I think late May to early June and late August to early September are the best times to visit. Prices are cheaper, the weather is decent, and the crowds are thinner.
  
 
 
 12. Pick up passengers
If you’re traveling on a budget, consider taking passengers. Having people chip in for gas for a leg or two of your journey is a great way to save money while also connecting with like-minded travelers. As mentioned above, you can use websites like Samferda or Couchsurfing to find them.
Another option is to pick up hitchhikers. In the warmer months, hitchhiking is super common along the Ring Road (I hitchhiked here and had a great experience). While they generally don’t have money to contribute, they likely have cool stories and great tips. It’s an easy way to help other travelers and liven up your own trip.
  13. Follow the rules of the road
Being a responsible traveler means following local norms and laws. Be aware that Iceland has stricter driving laws and penalties than you may be used to. Make sure to do the following:
Never drive off-road. Respect the fragile Icelandic ecosystem and never drive off-road.
Never drink and drive. Iceland has very strict laws about driving under the influence (0.02% is the limit). Not only are you endangering yourself and others, but the fines are extremely high (100,000 ISK).
Never use your phone while driving. Use a hands-free setup if you need to talk and drive, or else pull over. Not only is it dangerous, but you could face high fines as well.
Watch out for others on the road. This includes sheep (there are more sheep than people here) and cyclists. Pass slowly and give them a wide berth.
Know who to call. If you experience an emergency, dial 112 for assistance. It’s the equivalent of 911 in the US/Canada.
  Iceland Road Trip FAQ

How difficult is a road trip in Iceland?
Iceland is one of the easiest countries in the world for a road trip. The reason is that there is essentially just one long road that circles the country (known as Route 1, or the Ring Road). That makes it quite easy to get around and difficult to get lost.
How long do you need to road-trip around Iceland?
If you plan to drive the entire Ring Road, you’ll want at least 10 days (14 days would be better). If you just want to see the main sights in the south and east, 5-7 days should be plenty.
Is Iceland very expensive?
Iceland can be very expensive. Food, accommodation, rental cars, and gas are all pricey. However, there are plenty of ways to save too. By sharing a vehicle (and splitting costs), cooking all your meals, and camping or sticking to hostels, you can easily do it for under $100 USD per day.
Is it worth renting a 4×4?
I would only rent a 4×4 if you have prior road trip experience and are planning to go off road. For the average visitor looking to see the main sights, a 4×4 is not necessary.
What is an F-road?
An F-road is a route on which only 4×4 vehicles can travel. They are very rugged, unpaved roads, generally leading you into the interior.
If you have a regular rental vehicle, you’re forbidden to drive on them.
Is it safe to drive solo in Iceland?
Iceland is consistently ranked as one of the safest countries in the world. If you’re new to solo travel, it’s the perfect place to start.
***
Iceland is one of the most beautiful countries in the world. It’s also one of the best (and easiest) places to do a road trip. While it may be expensive, it’s very safe and easy to get around, and there are lots of free things to see and do to keep costs down. Just follow the tips above, and you’ll have a fun and safe visit to this rugged island nation!

Travel,1648,"THE 7 BEST HOTELS IN MADRID

Posted: 4/1/24 | April 1st, 2024
Madrid has it all: incredible food, world-class museums, stunning architecture, non-stop nightlife, and picturesque winding streets. The vibrant capital of Spain, here you can spend your days exploring iconic landmarks like the Prado Museum and your evenings luxuriating over glasses of wine in bustling tapas bars.
While my first visit to the city was a bit ill-fated (I was sick and spent most of the time in bed), I’ve been able to visit many times since then.
Over the years, I’ve stayed at lots of hotels here. To help you plan your visit, here’s my list of the best hotels in Madrid:
1. Petit Palace Puerta del Sol

This three-star hotel is housed in a 19th-century building a few steps from Puerta del Sol, Madrid’s central plaza. It’s a bargain given its amenities and location. The overall design is minimalist but cozy, with a warm color palette of salmon and peach tones. In the mornings, there’s an expansive buffet breakfast that caters to all diets with a wide variety of pastries, cold cuts, and fresh fruit.
The soundproofed rooms are compact (to be expected in such a central location) but optimize the space with flatscreen TVs, Wi-Fi, parquet floors, small desks, and minibars. The rooms are are minimalist with no real décor to speak of, though they’re clean and comfortable. Some rooms have a lot of natural light, while others are windowless, so if that matters to you, be sure to book a streetside room for a lovely view. The recently renovated bathrooms have rainfall showers with excellent water pressure.
Book here!

  2. Radisson RED Madrid

Located in Madrid’s Art Triangle (home to the city’s world-famous art museums), this four-star hotel is just steps away from lush green spaces like the botanical gardens and Retiro (the city’s main park). The hotel is very chic, with pops of their signature red color and fun artwork throughout. There are a ton of amenities here too, including a co-working space, fitness center, and three eateries designed by a Michelin-starred chef. The breakfast buffet is a bit pricey for Madrid, but it’s quite varied, including eggs, pastries, and fresh juice. I love the fact that it starts at 6:30am too (a lifesaver if you’re an early riser, as you won’t find anything else open for hours).
The rooms have a beautiful contemporary design, with artwork on the walls and ample amounts of natural light. Each room has a flatscreen TV, work desk, Nespresso machine, AC, safe, and a spacious bathroom. There are also family rooms and rooms with a massive private terrace available too. It’s an excellent place to stay if you plan on taking the high-speed rail elsewhere in Spain, as you’re right across from the main train station.
Book here!

  3. L&H La Latina

This aparthotel is located in La Latina, the culinary epicenter of Madrid. There are a variety of apartment types to choose from, including ones for small groups and ones with private terraces. All kitchenettes have a mini fridge, cooktop, microwave, toaster, Nespresso machine, and a little table to sit at. There’s no breakfast on site, but there are plenty of grocery stores and eateries just steps away.
The rooms and suites are painted in a calming sage green color, with minimalist décor and artwork on the walls. All apartments have a lot of natural light and feature a flatscreen TV, wardrobe, and AC. The large bathrooms have complimentary toiletries and showers that have excellent water pressure. Overall, this is a great centrally located hotel perfect for travelers who want extra space or access to a kitchen.

  4. Hotel Catalonia Goya

Set in a 19th-century building, this four-star hotel is right on Calle de Goya, one of the city’s most exclusive shopping streets. Despite being on such a busy street, the hotel is tranquil inside, with a plunge pool, fitness center, and soundproofed rooms. The hotel also offers a nice breakfast spread with fresh bread, pastries, cold cuts, fruit, and there’s also a cook preparing eggs and pancakes (there’s a machine for making your own freshly squeezed orange juice too).
The sizable rooms are clean and stylish, with a contemporary design and parquet floors. All rooms have a desk, smart TV with Chromecast, minibar, coffee maker, and safe. The bathrooms are spacious too and have hairdryers as well as large showers with good water pressure. While you’re walking distance to many attractions, the hotel is also right next to a metro station that can take you across the city in just a few stops. I think the value of what you get here is phenomenal.
Book here!

  5. Hotel Indigo Madrid–Princesa

The Indigo is an excellent mid-range accommodation option in Argüelles. The three-star property boasts a gym and a continental breakfast spread that includes cold cuts, pastries, fresh fruit, and tea/coffee. I really like the welcoming, colorful design of the rooms and the unique, nature-inspired artwork on the walls.
All room types have a large smart TV, minibar, Nespresso machine, and desk. The beds are comfy with extra plush duvets, and the bathrooms are large with nice walk-in showers, hair dryers, and comfy bathrobes. The hotel is walking distance to main sights like the Templo de Debod and Royal Palace, but you’re also just steps from a metro station so it’s easy to get across the city too.
Book here!

  6. VP Plaza España Design

This five-star hotel has a strong focus on art and design, with a private art collection made up of more than 300 original works by over a dozen artists. It’s located right on Plaza España (one of the city’s main plazas). The 12th-floor Gingko rooftop bar offers spectacular views over the entire city, great cocktails, and live music every week. The hotel restaurant serves an excellent breakfast buffet and there’s also a plunge pool, sauna, luxurious spa, and fitness center.
There are nine different types of rooms and suites to choose from here (including rooms with a private terrace, and others that have an elliptical and stationary bike). All are spacious and soundproofed, decorated with curated artwork and fresh flowers. In-room amenities include a minibar, desk, Nespresso machine, Bluetooth speakers, flatscreen TV with Chromecast, and 24-hour room service. The beds are super comfy and there are both blackout blinds as well as a pillow menu so that you can get a good night’s sleep. The bathrooms are large too, with a towel warmer, complimentary luxury toiletries, rainfall shower with excellent water pressure, and a separate bathtub. You won’t want for anything here!
Book here!

  7. Four Seasons Madrid

This five-star hotel is spread across seven historic buildings in the center of the city. I especially love the grand two-story lobby with its marble floors, ornate chandeliers, and intricately carved woodwork. While you’re just steps away from all of the city’s main attractions, there’s tons to do at the hotel too, with a beautiful indoor pool, spa, and 24/7 fitness center. There are several eateries here, including an award-winning cocktail bar and rooftop bar/restaurant. The breakfast buffet is fantastic as well.
The rooms here are fit for royalty, decorated in cream tones with contemporary art on the wall and lots of natural light from the large windows. All rooms include an array of furniture, including a chaise longue, desk, dining table, and amenities like a coffee maker, flatscreen TV, and minibar. The marble bathrooms are just as elegant, furnished with a deep bathtub and separate shower, thick terry bathrobes and slippers, and luxurious toiletries. There’s also a nightly turndown service as well as room service available 24/7. If you want to splurge, this is the hotel for you.

The sunny capital of Spain has so many things to see and do (and eat!) that you’ll be able to hard-pressed to fit them all in. But no matter how long you visit for, be sure to pick one of the hotels above. Do that, and you’ll have an unforgettable stay in one of the greatest cities in Europe!

Travel,1940,"WHERE TO STAY IN MILAN: THE BEST NEIGHBORHOODS FOR YOUR VISIT

Posted: 3/28/2024 | March 28th, 2024
Milan is a popular destination for travelers who are into fashion and design. But there’s a lot of history and culture here too. The city was both the former capital of the Western Roman Empire and influential during the Italian Renaissance. I consider it a must-visit stop on any trip around Italy.
As the country’s second largest city (over 6 million people live here), where you stay during your visit will have a big impact on your trip. While it’s pretty easy to get around the city, you don’t want to spend all your time in transit. Instead, you’ll want to pick an area that’s close to where you want to spend the majority of your time.
To help you do just that, here’s my list of the best neighborhoods in Milan for travelers:

  Where to Stay for First-Time Visitors: Centro Storico

Milan’s historic center boasts architectural gems like the Gothic Duomo, the 15th-century Sforza Castle, and the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II (a 19th-century shopping arcade). You’ll find plenty of art here too, from the huge Palazzo Reale (an 18th-century palace turned art museum) to the Church of Santa Maria delle Grazie (home to Leonardo Da Vinci’s The Last Supper).
The area is extremely walkable and filled with enchanting streets, quaint cafés, bustling piazzas, and fashionable boutiques (head to the subdistrict Quadrilatero d’Oro for the best luxury shopping). It’s the ideal place to stay if it’s your first time in Milan.
Best places to stay in Centro Storico:
BUDGET: Ostello Bello – Located just a few blocks from the Duomo, Ostello Bello is one of the best hostels in Milan. The facilities are extensive and include a guest kitchen with free food, a bar (where you get a free welcome drink), outdoor terraces, and an indoor lounge. There’s also a great breakfast in the mornings (7 EUR). The dorms are spacious, with comfy beds and en-suite bathrooms, and the helpful staff organizes tons of free events (like walking tours).
MIDRANGE: B&B Hotel Milano Sant’Ambrogio – This three-star hotel offers simple rooms in an excellent location. The rooms feature lots of natural light, desks, smart TVs, and bathrooms with walk-in showers and bidets. The breakfast buffet is quite varied for the price (9.50 EUR) and includes lots of pastries as well as fresh orange juice. Overall, this hotel offers great value for first-time visitors who want to stay somewhere central but not spend an arm and a leg.
LUXURY: Park Hyatt Milan – This five-star hotel located just off the main piazza seamlessly blends classic Italian architecture with contemporary design. Each room is spacious and elegantly furnished, with large luxurious marble bathrooms and all the amenities you’d expect from a hotel of this calibre. There are two restaurants on site, and one serves an exceptional breakfast buffet in the mornings. It’s a great place to redeem your Hyatt points too.
  Where to Stay for Arts & Culture: Brera

While technically part of Centro Storico, Brera is a neighborhood that has a completely different feel than the more touristy area around the Duomo. Known for its artistic vibe, it was once a bohemian haven for Italian writers, poets, artists, filmmakers, and intellectuals in the 1960s (they all gathered at the legendary Bar Jamaica, which is still around). The neighborhood’s narrow cobblestone streets are filled with art galleries and studios, antique shops, boutiques, and trendy cafés. It’s also great for food (though what place in Italy isn’t?), with a diverse selection of eateries serving both traditional Milanese cuisine and innovative dishes from around the world.
While a lot of the charm of staying here lies in wandering these picturesque, pedestrianized streets, there are also attractions like the Pinacoteca di Brera, the city’s best art museum; and the tranquil, 18th-century Brera Botanical Gardens. Plus, the neighborhood is just a short walk from Milan’s most famous sights in Centro Storico.
Best places to stay in Brera:
BUDGET: As this area is quite high-end, there aren’t any hostels here. Your best bet is to stay at the aforementioned Ostello Bello in the heart of Centro Storico.
MIDRANGE: Brera Prestige B&B – This three-star hotel is in a perfect location on a quiet street in the heart of Brera, just a 10-minute walk from the Duomo. There are only a few rooms at this boutique property and all are decorated in calming, neutral tones and have chromotherapy lights that you can turn different colors. Each is newly renovated, with soundproof windows, a spacious bathroom with a walk-in shower, a small fridge, and a flat-screen TV. The staff are very friendly too. Overall, it’s a nice place to stay that’s quiet yet still central to everything.
LUXURY: Bulgari Hotel Milano – This five-star boutique hotel is a luxurious and peaceful oasis in the heart of the city. It’s right next to the botanical gardens, and the hotel has a huge private garden of its own (with a bar/restaurant). The overall design is sleek and elegant. The rooms feature deep soaking tubs, walk-in showers, comfy king-sized beds, and minibars. There’s a tranquil indoor swimming pool and spa too.
  Where to Stay for Nightlife & Food: Navigli

While Venice is famous for its canals, Milan has several beautiful ones of its own. Picturesque bars and restaurants line the canals of Naviglio Grande and Naviglio Pavese, the heart of the city’s nightlife and the best place in town to enjoy aperitivo, the Italian answer to happy hour (a buffet of small bites that come included in the price of a drink at many bars). It’s also a great neighborhood for foodies, as there are many trattorias serving up delicious Italian cuisine, including traditional Milanese dishes, fresh seafood, and artisanal pizza and pasta.
Staying in Navigli offers a unique atmosphere that’s still within easy access to Centro Storico (it’s just a quick tram ride or 30-minute walk away).
Best places to stay in Navigli:
BUDGET: Combo Milan – Combo is a small Italian boutique-hostel chain. Its Navigli location offers both dorm beds and private rooms in an industrial-chic space. There’s a fantastic free breakfast spread, a beautiful inner courtyard (with a bar/restaurant), a co-working area, and a guest kitchen if you prefer to prepare your own meals. Dorm beds are comfy and have an individual outlet, reading light, and locker, though no privacy curtains. The showers have great pressure too, which is always a plus in my book.
MIDRANGE: Art Hotel Navigli – This four-star hotel is full of art, and walking down the halls almost feels like you’re in a modern museum. The rooms themselves are minimally decorated and a bit dated, but they’re spacious and all have a flat-screen TV, minibar, electric kettle, and Nespresso machine. I think the bathrooms are a bit small and dated but there’s great water pressure. The hotel also has a wellness center with a salt wall, sauna, and steam room, and there’s an expansive breakfast buffet.
LUXURY: Magna Pars l’Hotel à Parfum – This five-star hotel continues the tradition of the perfume factory in which it is housed, with a laboratory on-site and calming scents throughout the property. The spacious rooms are designed in soft tones, with modern art, floor-to-ceiling windows, desks, comfortable beds (you can choose your pillow from a menu), and luxurious bathrooms entirely made of marble. There’s an excellent complimentary breakfast buffet, a rooftop bar and restaurant, and a wellness center with a steam room and gym.
  Where to Stay to Feel Like a Local: Isola

Historically, Isola was a working-class district, with factories and warehouses dominating the landscape. In recent years though, it has undergone a significant transformation, becoming one of Milan’s trendiest neighborhoods.
Today, the area is a hub for artists, designers, and creatives. There’s much colorful street art here, and the industrial spaces have been repurposed into galleries, studios, and creative workspaces. The neighborhood has a bohemian atmosphere, with boutique shops, vintage stores, third-wave coffee shops, and artisanal markets, including the covered Mercato Comunale di Isola, featuring fresh produce, meats, cheeses, and other local gourmet products.
Best places to stay in Isola:
BUDGET: L’Isola di Romy – This budget-friendly guesthouse offers private rooms with shared bathrooms (which are always kept nice and clean). The rooms are simply furnished but spacious and painted in bright, cheerful colors. Each room has a flat-screen TV, wardrobe, and desk, and some even have a terrace. It’s a good no-frills place.
MIDRANGE: BB Hotels Aparthotel Isola – This aparthotel offers spacious apartments with fully equipped kitchenettes that include a cooktop, dishwasher, and electric kettle. They are minimally decorated but have lots of natural light, thanks to the floor-to-ceiling windows. The bathrooms are spacious too, with a bidet, a walk-in shower, and complimentary toiletries. There’s a little supermarket right underneath the apartments, making this the ideal choice if you want to prepare your own meals.
LUXURY: Isola isn’t exactly the best choice if you’re looking for luxury, as there aren’t a lot of hotels in this more residential neighborhood. If you are seeking a five-star property, though, head to Excelsior Hotel Gallia in the next neighborhood over, which boasts beautiful, spacious rooms, an indoor swimming pool, an excellent breakfast buffet, and a rooftop bar/restaurant.
***
Milan blends historical grandeur and contemporary chic. But there’s a lot more to the city too, whether you want to explore the street art scene or enjoy the energetic nightlife. By choosing one of the neighborhoods and accommodations above, you’ll be sure to have a fun stay in Italy’s fashion capital.
Book Your Trip to Milan: Logistical Tips and Tricks
Book Your Flight
Use Skyscanner to find a cheap flight. They are my favorite search engine because they search websites and airlines around the globe so you always know no stone is left unturned!
Book Your Accommodation
You can book your hostel with Hostelworld as they have the biggest inventory and best deals. If you want to stay somewhere other than a hostel, use Booking.com as they consistently return the cheapest rates for guesthouses and cheap hotels.
Don’t Forget Travel Insurance
Travel insurance will protect you against illness, injury, theft, and cancellations. It’s comprehensive protection in case anything goes wrong. I never go on a trip without it as I’ve had to use it many times in the past. My favorite companies that offer the best service and value are:
Safety Wing (best for everyone)
Insure My Trip (for those over 70)
Medjet (for additional evacuation coverage)

Travel,1357,"THE 6 BEST HOTELS IN PRAGUE

Posted: 3/28/24 | March 28th, 2024
Prague is one of my favorite cities in Europe. Ever since my first visit in 2006, I’ve loved coming here. The winding cobblestone streets, medieval buildings, and spacious squares give the city an unrivaled historic allure.
Prague has skyrocketed in popularity. It gets crowded in the summer and I don’t even feel like there’s a shoulder season anymore. Just people. All the time. The rising popularity has lead to tons of new development, hostels, and hotels. And, even though it’s a small city, where you stay will have a big impact on how crowded you feel the city it.
To help you plan your visit, here’s my list of the best hotels in Prague:
1. Hotel Metamorphis

This four-star hotel is located in a historic building right near the Old Town Square. The rooms are bright, spacious, and airy, with a lot of natural light. The décor is a little dated, but the rooms feature light colors and distinct touches, such as exposed beams or unique tiles. Rooms also include a flatscreen TV, minibar, desk, and coffee maker. The bathrooms look a little dated but they are super spacious. A tasty breakfast with eggs, meat, and fresh bread can be included (though it’s located in a nearby building so you have to walk a couple minutes to access it).
What makes this hotel an excellent choice, aside from the convenient location, is that there is a beer spa on-site. Guests can soak in a wooden tub filled with beer while also enjoying unlimited beer to drink. It doesn’t get more Czech than this!
Book here!

  2. Czech Inn

This three-star hotel is part hotel, part hostel, so there are both private rooms and dorms here. It’s a solid no-frills choice that’s more social than your average hotel, with free walking tours and a lively on-site bar where it’s easy to meet people. The breakfast buffet is filling and has a lot of variety (it’s affordable too). There’s also a well-equipped kitchen in case you want to cook your own meals.
The décor is rustic, with lots of exposed brick throughout. The private rooms are colorful but simple, with lots of natural light that contrasts with the darker colors and furniture. Some rooms even have hardwood or parquet floors. Rooms include a TV, coffee/tea maker, and desk. It’s also just a one-minute walk to the city center. Overall, it’s an inexpensive choice for budget travelers who want a central location.
Book here!

  3. Augustine

Set in a still-working monastery from the Middle Ages, this posh five-star property has 100 large rooms spread out over seven buildings. There’s a luxurious spa on site as well as a 24/7 fitness center with a sauna and steam room. Each room is large and airy, with lots of natural light. Rooms feature stylish furniture, including sofas or armchairs, and historic touches like exposed beams. The beds are super comfy, and rooms also include a flatscreen TV, minibar, and coffee/tea maker. The bathrooms are large and elegant, with beautiful tilework, great water pressure, and even a bidet.
There’s a beautiful courtyard on-site as well as a delicious breakfast (though it’s not cheap). What really sets this hotel apart though is that the basement bar serves homemade beer brewed from the recipe of the monks who live in an adjacent building.
Book here!

  4. Botanique Hotel

Located in Karlin, a popular foodie neighborhood, this four-star hotel is chic and minimalist, with an eco-friendly focus. The recently renovated rooms feature lots of light wood, soft colors, and large windows that invite in lots of natural light. The rooms are spacious too, and include a flatscreen smart TV, desk, minifridge, Nespresso machine, and complimentary bottled water. The bathrooms, which are also spacious and modern, include organic bath products as well as rain showers with great pressure.
There’s both a fitness center and a restaurant on-site that focuses on local and seasonal ingredients. They also serve an excellent buffet breakfast each morning that has a ton of variety (including plenty of gluten-free and vegan options).
Book here!

  5. Art Hotel

This arty property is located near the National Gallery. The avant-garde hotel has its own collection of Czech modern art too. Each boutique room has unique art and stylish décor featuring lots of neutral tones and wooden furniture. The rooms are really big and have large windows that bring in lots of natural light. They also include comfy beds, desks, flatscreen TVs, minibars, and coffee/tea makers. The bathrooms are simple but have excellent water pressure. The breakfast has decent variety too, though the veg options are a bit limited.
This hotel is a good choice for travelers looking to indulge in the city’s nightlife, as the hotel is located in Vršovice, a popular neighborhood for bar hopping that gets busy on the weekends.
Book here!

  6. Dancing House

This is the most unique hotel in Prague. A four-star property, it’s set in a dynamic Frank Gehry-designed building that offers views of Prague Castle and the Old Town (the iconic building looks like it’s moving, hence the name). The upscale rooms are elegant and minimalist, featuring stylish neutral tones. The beds are super comfy, and rooms also include a flatscreen TV, coffee/tea maker, electric kettle, desk, minibar, and excellent soundproofing so you can get a decent sleep. The bathrooms are large and include complimentary toiletries, a bidet, and showers with detachable showerheads and excellent water pressure.
The breakfast has a lot of variety, including lots of fresh fruit, and there’s both a bar and restaurant on-site. The hotel is located in Naplavka, a neighborhood situated right by the river that’s brimming with bars and restaurants. This is the perfect choice for travelers who want a unique and memorable stay (it’s surprisingly affordable too).

Travel,1301,"THE 6 BEST HOTELS IN BUDAPEST

Posted: 3/28/24 | March 28th, 2024
I didn’t know what to expect when I first visited Budapest. I thought it would a drab, bland city, owing to its Communist past.
Fortunately, I was wrong.
Once under the radar, Budapest has been growing in popularity thanks to its affordability and its lively nightlife. The city also has photogenic architecture and layers of interesting history, making it a well-rounded choice for anyone visiting Europe.
I’ve been visiting the city for over a decade and always have an amazing time. I love the city so much that, for a couple year, I used to run tours and brought readers to it.
Naturally, I’ve stayed at countless hotels over the years. Here’s my list of the best hotels in Budapest:
1. Bohem Art Hotel

Staying here feels like you’re staying in an art gallery. This four-star hotel has a very retro design. I especially love the art in the lounge and rooms (there are lots of unique photos and murals). The hotel is right near the river too, as well as the popular Váci utca pedestrian shopping street.
The beds here are comfy and the rooms have plenty of outlets, as well as an electric kettle, AC, minibar, desk, and flatscreen TV. The rooms aren’t huge, but they feature lots of natural light from the large windows. The breakfast is great and has lots of options (including a freshly squeezed orange juice machine) and the showers are super powerful too. Overall, it’s a solid midrange choice in the heart of the city.
Book here!

  2. Matild Palace

Centrally located in the popular District V, this luxe five-star hotel looks like a palace. The ornate Belle Epoque complex boasts an expansive breakfast spread, a large gym, a sauna and multiple restaurants. There’s even a nightclub on-site too. It’s a massive property and you’ll feel like royalty staying here.
The rooms are lavish, blending historic charm with modern design. There are stylish chairs and plush velvet sofas, comfy beds with thick mattresses, and a large bathroom with beautiful tiles. Rooms embrace light and neutral tones and also have AC, flatscreen TVs, desks, and coffee/tea makers. If you want to splash out, this hotel will not disappoint.
Book here!

  3. Monastery Boutique Hotel

Located in a 300-year-old abbey, this four-star hotel features original exposed brick and stone walls in many of its rooms (as well as in the restaurant area, which looks really cool). The décor is simple and minimalist, with a relaxing light palette. The breakfast is delicious, featuring fresh pastries, fruit, yoghurt, eggs, veggies, and lots of fresh bread. The hotel is right near Fisherman’s Bastion and Castle Hill too, making it a convenient base for sightseeing.
The beds here are comfy and the rooms are bright and airy, with lots of natural light. The bathrooms are spacious, with towel warmers and showers with good water pressure. There are desks, electric kettles, and flatscreen TVs in each room too. Overall, it’s an elegant property in a convenient location with a price that won’t break the bank.
Book here!

  4. Mirage Medic Hotel

Located in District VI on the Pest side of town, this four-star hotel is housed in a massive, regal 19th-century mansion. The rooms may feel a bit dated, but they’re clean, spacious, and the beds are comfortable. Rooms also have a desk, flatscreen TV, and electric kettle and the water pressure in the showers is good too. There’s a simple free breakfast of bread, coffee, and cereals each morning as well. It’s not fancy, but it is included in the price, which I appreciate.
The hotel also offers holistic healing programs, such as herbal remedies and acupuncture. The main draw, however, is how close this hotel is to Széchenyi, the most popular thermal spa in Budapest. It’s just a short 7-minute walk away.
Book here!

  5. Vagabond Grand’Or

Located in the Jewish Quarter, this modern apart-hotel features spacious rooms with balconies and kitchens, perfect for families or travelers who want to cook their own meals. There are sofas and flatscreen TVs (with Netflix), a dinner table if you want to eat in, and a washing machine. The rooms have comfy beds and the overall design is stylish but minimal, featuring lots of light tones with splashes of color. The bathrooms aren’t huge, but they are clean and the showers have good water pressure. There’s a simple breakfast offered each morning too (with veg options). Overall, it’s a comfortable, no-frills spot near the must-visit Dohany Street Synagogue.
Book here!

  6. Anantara NY Palace

This is an immensely lavish five-star hotel. It has an opulent interior and palatial lobby, featuring massive ornate pillars and a lofty ceiling that looks like it belongs in Versailles. The property has an indoor pool, sauna, steam bath, and large fitness center. I especially love the hotel’s historic 20th-century café (it’s a gorgeous coffee house). As a guest, you can enjoy an extraordinary breakfast spread here before the café opens to the public each day. There’s also an elegant bar, which has live piano music and serves excellent drinks.
The rooms are huge and airy, with lots of dark colors and sleek, stately décor. Each room has super comfy beds, desks and sofas, a minibar, and a flatscreen TV. The bathrooms are also huge, with gorgeous tiles and marble, massive bathtubs, and a separate walk-in shower. You’ll be hard-pressed to find a more luxurious hotel in the city.

Travel,1321,"THE 6 BEST HOTELS IN MILAN

Posted: 3/27/24 | March 27th, 2024
Italy’s second-largest city is best known as the fashion and design capital of the world, drawing millions of visitors each year. There’s also a ton of history here too (the city used to be the capital of the Western Roman Empire). And, shortly, Milan will take center-stage on the world’s arena as host city to the 2026 Winter Olympics.
But no matter what brings you to Milan, it’s important to pick a good hotel while you are here. I’ve been visiting the city for years and have stayed in a ton of different places.
To help you find a hotel that suits your needs and budget, here’s my list of the best hotels in Milan:
1. Brera Prestige B&B

This three-star hotel is in a perfect location in the heart of Brera, only a 10-minute walk from the famous Duomo (cathedral). There are just a few rooms at this newly renovated boutique property, which is stylish and modern. Each room has soundproof windows, a mini fridge, a desk, and a flatscreen TV. The rooms are decorated in calming, neutral tones, and even have chromotherapy lights that you can turn different colors (each color has different purported healing properties, but it’s also just fun too).
The bathrooms are spacious with a walk-in shower and bidet. The staff is very friendly too. It’s a nice and quiet place that’s still central to everything. Just note that, while it’s called a B&B, it does not actually offer breakfast.
Book here!

  2. B&B Hotel Milano Sant’Ambrogio

This three-star hotel in Centro Storico offers simple rooms with large-scale photographs of Milan on the walls. The bright and airy rooms are a pretty good size and have lots of natural light thanks to the large windows. The beds are really comfortable, and all rooms have a desk, flatscreen TV, and wardrobe. The bathrooms are on the smaller side but have walk-in showers and bidets.
I especially love the fact that the breakfast buffet is quite varied and includes lots of pastries as well as fresh orange juice (it costs 9.50 EUR though). There’s also a rooftop terrace with great views as well as a little snack bar downstairs if you want to grab some late-night munchies but not leave the hotel. Overall, the hotel offers great value for first-time visitors who want to stay somewhere central but not spend an arm and a leg.
Book here!

  3. Art Hotel Navigli

This four-star hotel is full of art (walking down the halls, it almost feels like you’re in a modern art museum). The hotel also has a wellness center with a small gym, sauna, and steam room. I love the expansive breakfast buffet too. It starts early (7am) and there’s a nice spread with eggs, meat, fresh pastries, and seasonal fruit. You can even make your own fresh juice with the juice maker.
The rooms are a bit dated, but they’re spacious and each has a flatscreen TV, minibar, electric kettle, and Nespresso machine. The showers are a bit small and dated as well, though they have great water pressure. It’s a unique place to stay that’s just steps from one of the Navigli’s beautiful canals.

  4. Magna Pars l’Hotel à Parfum

This five-star hotel continues the tradition of the perfume factory in which it is housed, with a perfume laboratory on site and calming scents throughout the property. The entire property features soft tones and has modern art everywhere. There’s an excellent complimentary buffet breakfast, rooftop bar, wine lounge, and a wellness center with a steam room and gym.
Each of the hotel’s 68 spacious suites has its own unique scent, which have also inspired the unique artwork created by local artists adorning the walls. All suites have floor-to-ceiling windows, hardwood floors, and comfy beds (you can even choose your pillow from a pillow menu). Every suite includes a desk, flatscreen TV, minibar, and leather chaise longue to relax in. The luxurious bathrooms are huge and entirely made of marble, with bespoke toiletries that are (of course) uniquely scented. Overall, this hotel is the perfect option for travelers looking for a luxurious retreat that’s still close to the Navigli canals with its great bars and restaurants.

  5. BB Hotels Aparthotel Isola

Located in the street-art-filled neighborhood of Isola, this aparthotel offers spacious apartments with fully equipped kitchenettes. Each apartment includes a cooktop, dishwasher, and electric kettle. There’s a little supermarket right underneath the apartments too, making this the ideal choice if you want to prepare your own meals (there’s no breakfast offered).
The apartments are minimally decorated but have lots of natural light thanks to the floor-to-ceiling windows, and closets to store your stuff in. The bathrooms are spacious too, with a bidet, walk-in shower, towel warmers, and complimentary toiletries. This is a great choice for long-term travelers who want the full functionality of an apartment a bit away from the touristy Duomo area.

The hotel’s rooms are spacious and decorated with elegant Bulgari furnishings and wooden accenting. All rooms feature comfy beds, desks, walk-in closets, and minibars. The bathrooms are huge, with deep soaking tubs, walk-in showers, and complimentary bath products. If you want to spend some money, this is the hotel to do it at!

Travel,1130,"THE BEST WALKING TOURS IN FLORENCE

Posted: 3/27/24 | March 27, 2024
Florence is one of the most popular cities in Italy. Its stunning Renaissance architecture gives it an iconic look, and the abundance of art could keep any traveler busy for weeks. There’s the Galleria de Uffizi, which holds some of the world’s most important Renaissance pieces; Michelangelo’s David, one of the most recognizable works in the world; and the towering Duomo, a Gothic cathedral and UNESCO World Heritage Site.
To see it all and learn about this beautiful destination, I always like to take a walking tour (or three!) while I’m here. I think walking tours are a great way to learn about a place and see some non-touristy sites.
And Florence has a lot of them! From introductory free tours to in-depth history and food tours, here’s my list of the best walking tours in Florence.
BEST OVERALL TOUR

LEARN MORE
Take Walks
Take Walks is my go-to tour company in Italy, offering access to places that no other gets and featuring incredibly knowledgeable guides. I always have fun and learn a ton on these tours. I can’t recommend them enough.
Their VIP David & Duomo tour offers exclusive access before or after all the other tours, providing a unique, skip-the-line experience without the crowds. They also have a Best of Florence tour that covers all the city’s highlights over a fun and educational three hours.
BEST FREE TOUR

LEARN MORE
Florence Free Tour Tale
This is the best (and most popular) free tour in town. Its main offering is a solid introduction to Florence lasting two hours and covering all the highlights. It’s a great way to kick-start your trip if you’re on a budget.
For something more unique, there’s also a free tour that focuses on the city’s darker side, including some of the more eerie myths and legends from the past. Just remember to tip your guide at the end!
 
While those may be the best free and paid tours in town, Florence as a lot more to offer. Here are four other insightful and educational tours:
1. Devour Food Tours
Devour is my favorite food tour company. Its offerings are always super informative and delicious. In Florence, Devour runs a few different ones, so there’s something for everyone.
If you love wine like I do, the Oltrarno at Sunset tour is the best choice for you. An evening tour, it lasts over three hours and includes stops at five family-run businesses, where you’ll sample aperitivi, dinner (including a taste of the famed Florentine steak), and desserts.
Devour also runs a filling 3.5-hour Tastes and Traditions tour that includes a visit to Sant’Ambrogio Market, as well as wine, espresso, and some unforgettable eats. On both tours, you’ll end up full and learn a ton.
Tours start at 79 EUR.

  2. Italy Pass Tours
If you want to learn more about the Duomo, the massive cathedral that pokes up from the picturesque skyline, Italy Pass Tours runs an excellent short tour that serves as the perfect primer. You’ll get skip-the-line access and be able to tour the beautiful cathedral while learning about its history and how it intertwines with the famous Medici family that helped put Florence on the map. It’s an educational, affordable tour that goes into more detail than the standard free one, without being too long or overly academic.
Tours start at 13 EUR.

  3. Tours and Tours
If you want to explore the home of some of the world’s best Renaissance art, Tours and Tours runs a 90-minute skip-the-line Uffizi Gallery tour. You’ll get to marvel at world-famous works by masters like Botticelli, Michelangelo, and Leonardo da Vinci while avoiding the massive lines. They also run a short but insightful skip-the-line tour of Brunelleschi’s Dome. It’s a masterwork of engineering and offers amazing views over the city.
Tours start at 41 EUR.
Book here!

  4. Global Experiences
If you want to get off the beaten path and learn about Florence’s dark side, Global Experiences runs a bar crawl/ghost tour, which lasts three hours and takes you around town, showing you the sights while bouncing between cool bars. It also illuminates some of the more scandalous stories from the past, as well as darker and more mysterious tales. Overall, it’s a fun tour to take after a day of seeing the highlights.
The company also runs a more traditional food tour on which you’ll get to sample traditional Florentine steak, Tuscan meatballs, almond biscotti, gelato, and more!
Tours start at 60 EUR.

Travel,1296,"THE 6 BEST HOTELS IN VIENNA

Posted: 3/21/24 | March 21st, 2024
I think Vienna is one of the most beautiful cities in Europe. The historic core of the city is a massive UNESCO Heritage Site brimming with incredible museums, beautiful galleries, and sprawling Baroque palaces.
The city is a history buff’s dream and there’s a lot more to see and do here. There’s an incredible café culture, a nearby wine region, tons of amazing eateries, awesome live music (including world-class opera), and much more.
I’ve been coming here for years and I never get tired of visiting. (I love the city so much I used to run tours here!)
Naturally, I’ve stayed at countless hotels during my visits. Here’s my list of the best hotels in Vienna:
1. Hotel-Pension Wild

This two-star hotel is one of the few affordable lodgings in the city center. It has simple but bright rooms that feature comfortable beds, plenty of space, and large windows that let in a lot of natural light. The design is a bit dated (the carpeted rooms don’t look particularly stylish) but everything is clean and functional. Rooms include basic amenities like a flatscreen TV, desk, and free Wi-Fi. The bathrooms are pretty small, but they’re clean and the showers have good water pressure. The hotel offers a hearty continental breakfast and the owner is friendly and welcoming. If you’re on a tight budget, there are small, no-frills single rooms with a shared bathroom available as well.
Book here!
  2. Hotel Domizil

This boutique four-star hotel has small, clean rooms with décor that makes you feel like you’re back in Vienna’s imperial past. The rooms have plenty of light and lots of antique touches, such as wooden desks and tables, and upholstered armchairs. Rooms also have free Wi-Fi, a flatscreen TV, and a coffee/tea maker. The bathrooms, while not particularly fashionable (the tiles are kind of ugly), are very spacious and the showers have excellent water pressure. The breakfast, which can be included in the price, has tons of variety, including lots of different fresh breads and cheeses.
Located in the city center, I think this is one of the best value places to stay if you want to be in the center of it all.
Book here!

  3. Hotel Mozart

One of the few hotels in the Rossau neighborhood (just northwest of the city center), this budget-friendly three-star hotel boasts large rooms with lots of natural light. Rooms are spacious and decorated in light colors and feature hardwood or parquet floors. There are lots of other wooden touches too, such as desks/tables, and large wooden headboards. Free Wi-Fi is included, as is a flatscreen TV and AC (a must if you’re visiting in the summer). Some rooms include coffee machines. The hotel boasts a filling breakfast spread each morning with lots of fresh fruit and pastries. There’s also a bar on-site and the staff are always happy to share their tips and advice too.
Book here!

  4. Hotel Johann Strauss

Located in the Wieden neighborhood, this stylish four-star hotel is named after the eponymous 19th-century Austrian composer. The hotel is set in a historic Art Nouveau building that’s been entirely renovated, with rooms that have lots of natural light and a soft, welcoming color palette. Rooms include a flatscreen TV, minibar, coffee/tea maker, desk, and sofa. I really like that there’s a lot of art around the property, including in the rooms (naturally, much of the art is music centered). The tiled bathrooms are huge, with lots of light and great water pressure. I especially like that the breakfast buffet is enormous and features a lot of variety. The staff is exceptionally friendly too and happy to help you make the most of your stay.
Book here!

  5. Hotel Am Konzerthaus Vienna

Located in Landstrasse near the iconic Belvedere Palace, this luxe four-star hotel feels more like a five-star property. It has a chic lobby and large, bright rooms with super comfy beds. Everything is fashionable and trendy, with lots of rich colors from a darker palette. The large bathrooms are bedecked with dark tiles and are well lit, featuring plush bathrobes and relaxing rain showers. Rooms also include a flatscreen TV, desk, and coffee/tea maker. The breakfast buffet is huge and has a lot of options, but I especially love that the on-site restaurant has a Michelin star (it does amazing modern takes on traditional Austrian dishes).
The hotel is a perfect choice for travelers who want some luxury without breaking the bank.
Book here!

  6. The Ritz-Carlton Vienna

This is arguably the fanciest hotel in town. A five-star property right in the heart of the city, this hotel is spread across four historic palaces (yes, actual palaces). While the hotel feels palatial, it has understated décor with a chic minimalist design (think lots of white space with touches of color or artwork). The marble bathrooms are huge and the showers have perfect water pressure. The rooms are also massive and have big, comfy beds (as well as desks, AC, sofas, and electric kettles).
There’s also a gigantic breakfast buffet offered each morning and a free glass of champagne when you check in. The hotel also has a pool that plays music underwater, a fitness center, sauna, steam room, and three different spas on-site. In short, it’s the pinnacle of luxury in the city and the best choice for travelers looking to splurge on an elegant stay.

Travel,1984,"HOW TO EXPERIENCE MILWAUKEE LIKE A LOCAL

Posted: 3/15/2024 | March 15th, 2024
The following guest post is by my friends Adam from the website Getting Stamped. He and his wife are long time residents of Milwaukee and, since I’ve never been, I’ve invited him on to share some tips about visiting the city.
Milwaukee is underrated, in my opinion. I love it!
The largest city in Wisconsin and only 1.5 hours north of Chicago, it is the perfect size: not too small not too big. It offers tasty food and drinks, great sports teams, and fun festivals. Plus, it’s affordable. And don’t forget the friendly locals!
I have lived here my whole life, and my wife has lived here for 20 years. We’ve traveled around the world many times, and when it came time to plant roots and start a family, we could have gone anywhere. But we choose to come home to Milwaukee, which has so much to offer.
If you want to know how to experience it like a local, here are my insider tips:
Table of Contents
1. Stay central
2. Take advantage of free rides
3. Eat like a local
4. Indulge in local delicacies
5. Explore brewing history
6. Do some affordable activities
7. Enjoy free-admission days
8. Chase cheap happy hours
9. Explore the vibrant public art scene

  1. Stay central
I highly recommend staying downtown or the Third Ward. This is where most of the popular attractions are located. The hotels might be slightly more expensive than elsewhere, but you’ll save on transportation costs since everything is walkable.
These are two hotels I love:
Holiday Inn Express Milwaukee Downtown – This hotel is located within walking distance of Lake Michigan, Fiserv Forum, Deer District, and the Milwaukee Public Market, as well as numerous restaurants.
Cambria Hotel Milwaukee Downtown – This modern hotel with nice guest rooms and amenities is situated right between Downtown and the Third Ward.
  2. Take advantage of free rides
Milwaukee does not have a subway system, but it does have an amazing free streetcar service called the Hop, with numerous stops downtown and around the Third Ward area. Simply hop on and off — no tickets or reservations are needed! The Hop runs every 15 minutes during peak times and every 20 minutes off-peak and weekends. Click here for the map and schedule.
Insider tip: If you are heading to a sporting event, many bars and restaurants offer free shuttles to American Family Field for Brewer baseball games and concerts, Summerfest Grounds for festivals and concerts, Fiserv Forum for Bucks basketball games, and other events around town.
  3. Eat like a local

You might think Milwaukee’s all beer and cheese (and there is no shortage of those), but the food scene has a lot more to offer. Milwaukee has its own (sometimes quirky) food traditions and staples, like ButterBurgers and frozen custard.
It also has some incredible markets, where you can enjoy some of the city’s best food from many vendors, all in one place and in a fun and affordable food-hall atmosphere. These are two of my favorites:
3rd Street Market Hall – This is a must-visit destination, as it provides a place for tourists and locals alike to enjoy Milwaukee’s diverse cuisine. Here, you will find the aforementioned frozen custard, plus pho, pizza, burgers, artisan sandwiches, tacos, hot dogs, home-cooked meals, ramen, sushi, arepas, and so much more — all at affordable prices.
Milwaukee Public Market – Located in the historic Third Ward, this awesome market is the best place to patronize a wide variety of vendors with unique products, food offerings, and drink pairings. It’s a unique spot to experience the flavors of Milwaukee’s culinary scene, all under one roof, and soak in the local culture while shopping or grabbing a bite.
  4. Indulge in local delicacies

There are a few foods that you need to try that you (maybe for good reason) will not find many other places. They are unique, tasty, and overall pretty affordable!
Deep-fried cheese curds – Yes, it’s a thing, and they are amazing — order them and thank us later. Lakefront Brewery is our top pick.
Frozen custard – It may look like ice cream, but it’s much richer and creamier, with a few extra ingredients. Kopps is the best place for it (and great burgers) — and also one of those places that, if you don’t go, did you even visit Milwaukee?
Bratwursts – Another Milwaukee staple. Nobody does them at a higher level than Vanguard Restaurant in the Bayview neighborhood. It is best known for its amazing house-made sausages, including vegan options, with many at an affordable price of under $10.
In this list, we have only focused on the Milwaukee favorites, but foodies who want to delve deeper into the culinary scene may also want to check out our full list of the best restaurants in Milwaukee.
  
 
 
 5. Explore brewing history
While microbreweries aren’t exactly a new trend, Milwaukee has been brewing since before it was cool. At one time, it brewed more beer than any city in the world. That history is evident all around town in breweries, restaurants, and pubs.
Lakefront Brewery offers probably the best brewery tour in the city. It’s a lot more fun than just looking at shiny tanks and sniffing a pungent jar filled with hops. The tour guides are hilarious (some are literally comedians from a local club), and your tour will include four beer samples. This is by far the best value and our personal favorite tour — plus, the beer hall is a lot of fun. The tours are super popular and sell out on the weekends, so it is advised to purchase tickets in advance.
If you want to keep sampling local beers, make sure to check out a few other of my favorite Milwaukee breweries:
MobCraft Beer – This brewery offers tours and also has a great taproom with tasty pizzas, as well as really good IPAs and sour beers.
Eagle Park Brewing Company – They do not offer tours, but they do have a huge selection of unique sour beers.
Good City Brewing – There are two locations: the Eastside one offers tours, and the downtown one does not. But the latter is right across the street from Fiserv Forum and great place for a beer before a game.
  6. Do some affordable activities

Milwaukee has way more to do than we could squeeze onto this page, but we’ve narrowed it down, focusing on must-do and budget-friendly options (some are even free!):
Bradford Beach – This is a sandy park on the shorelines of Lake Michigan. Bring a towel and go for a swim, join in a game of beach volleyball, or grab custard at MooSa’s or lunch at The Dock Waterfront Bar & Grill.
Stroll the Milwaukee Riverwalk – Experience the heart of the city, and immerse yourself in its culture. Many of the Milwaukee’s best shops and restaurants can be found along the three-mile route along both sides of the Milwaukee River.
Disc-golf at Milwaukee County Parks – Milwaukee has 11 disc-golf courses — six full ones ($5) and five short-practice ones (free).
Bike the Oak Leaf Trail – Milwaukee County offers over 135 miles of trails for cycling, many of which feature scenic views of Lake Michigan. You can find the trail map here.
Bronze Fonz – Stop to take a picture with a bronze sculpture of Arthur Fonzarelli, aka the Fonz, from Happy Days (a sitcom about a Milwaukee family in the 1950s).
Indoor lawn games at 3rd Street Market Hall – Enjoy a variety of unique restaurants and free indoor games, including giant Jenga, cornhole, shuffleboard, and golf simulators. It’s a fun place, especially when the weather isn’t great!
After you’ve scoured this guide, if you need to fill any blank spots in your itinerary, we have an in-depth list covering all of the things to do in Milwaukee.
  7. Enjoy free-admission days
Some of Milwaukee’s top attractions welcome visitors for free on certain days. Watching the calendar can score you free tickets that otherwise would set your group back hundreds.
Milwaukee Zoo – Family Free Days are one Saturday per month. Check the schedule for upcoming dates.
Milwaukee Public Museum – Free first Thursdays (10am–3pm).
Villa Terrace Decorative Arts Museum – Free first Wednesdays (1–5pm).
Charles Allis Art Museum – Free first Thursdays (10am–5pm).
  8. Chase cheap happy hours
For better or worse, the people of Milwaukee enjoy their fun times intertwined with a beer or three. To kick off an exciting night in Milwaukee, head to where the locals go: find a good happy hour, or go to a budget-friendly dive bar.
McGillycuddy’s – $1 taps, $2 craft beers, $4 rails and mixers, and $5 appetizers (Tuesday–Friday, 3–7pm).
Mo’s Irish Pub – $2.72 drafts, $5 wines (Tues–Thurs 4–6pm, Fridays 3–6pm); also free brewery shuttles.
Milwaukee Brat House – Happy hour specials change daily (Mon–Fri 3-6pm).
  9. Explore the vibrant public art scene
Many places around town have large-scale public art displays that you can visit for free. Most of these pieces are in some of the most fun and trendy areas. These are a couple of our favorites:
Black Cat Alley – One of the largest areas dedicated to public murals is located near North Avenue, in the Eastside neighborhood. In addition to the art, you’ll also find great restaurants, breweries, and artisanal shops.
Sculpture Milwaukee – Annually, this city-funded program displays sculptures by artists from across the world on Wisconsin Avenue. Some are permanent and some are changed out every year, so there are always new things to see.
***
From food to free days and bratwurst to beer, Milwaukee has a ton of things to do and see on a budget. Hopefully this list will give you a good idea of where to start!

Travel,1253,"THE 5 BEST HOTELS IN SINGAPORE

Posted: 3/15/24 | March 15th, 2024
Singapore is one of my favorite cities in the world. It has an iconic skyline of futuristic skyscrapers, lush green spaces, and is one of the best foodie hubs in the region. The markets here are brimming with cheap hawker stalls, including stalls offering some of the most affordable Michelin-starred meals in the world.
But Singapore is expensive. It’s easy to blow your budget here. While you can get cheap meals, accommodation will eat away at your budget.
Over the years, I’ve stayed at countless hotels in Singapore, so today I want to share my list of the best hotels in Singapore:
1. The Scarlet
This award-winning four-star hotel is in Chinatown, my favorite area of the city. It’s spread across restored 19th-century shophouses and an Art Deco building from the 1920s (you can’t miss its distinctive red façade). The inside is bright and bold, with rich colors and plush furnishings. The hotel also boasts a rooftop restaurant and bar, an outdoor hot tub, a gym, and a French patisserie where you can get fresh pastries in the mornings.
The stylish rooms are uniquely designed with avant-garde décor like colorful velvet chaise longues and unique headboards. The bathrooms are spacious, the beds are comfy, and you can even choose your pillow from a custom pillow menu. All rooms offer flatscreen TVs, work desks, complimentary minibars, luxurious bathrobes, and tea/coffee-making appliances. If you want a more mid-range option in Chinatown, stay here.
Book here!

  2. KINN Capsule Hotel

Capsule hotels are something you’ve got to experience at least once in Asia. Think of them a bit like an elevated hostel. KINN is one of a handful of capsule hotels in the Quays area. This hotel is minimally designed, everything is super clean, and you’ll get a small free breakfast (a sandwich and fruit) in the mornings. There’s also a pantry with free snacks, coffee and tea, a shared lounge, a laundry facility, and a rooftop terrace with a beautiful view. I especially like that guests get free access to fitness classes at a nearby gym, as well as discounts on a co-working space a couple of blocks away.
The capsules have AC and feature comfortable bedding, a foldable shelf and mirror, integrated lighting, blackout privacy blinds, and power outlets. You’ll also get a personal locker to secure your stuff. The shared bathrooms have large showers with good pressure. There are free toiletries too. If you want a bit more privacy than a capsule, you can choose to stay in a private room with its own bathroom. This place is a great option if you’re looking to save money but you don’t want to stay in a hostel.

  3. Park Royal Collection Pickering

This luxury five-star hotel has been featured in a ton of international publications thanks to its focus on sustainability. They harvest rainwater, have solar panels for energy generation, and use green roofs to minimize heat absorption and grow produce. There are also beautiful gardens and lush living walls everywhere. On the scenic garden skywalk, you can take free classes (yoga, meditation, Zumba). There’s also an outdoor pool and a gym, as well as several restaurants. While the breakfast buffet isn’t included, it is fantastic, with a huge and varied spread. The hotel is right next to an MRT station too.
Rooms here are spacious and feature a contemporary design with light wood paneling, a neutral color palette, and large windows. All rooms come with a spacious work desk with an ergonomic chair, a flatscreen TV, a minibar, plush bathrobes, and nightstands with universal electrical outlets. The bathrooms are also large and feature a standing shower with excellent pressure as well as a deep soaking tub. There’s even a separate faucet for filtered drinking water, which I think is a nice touch. Stay here for a unique and luxurious stay in the heart of Chinatown.

  4. Santa Grand Hotel

This three-star hotel is on East Coast Road and not far from Joo Chiat, an area of town with lots of street art, independent stores, and cafés. The rooms are compact and simple but include a complimentary minibar, a flatscreen TV, and a desk. Bathrooms are good sized and feature a bidet and either a walk-in shower or shower/tub combo. There are a variety of room types to choose from, and some even have balconies or a skylight.
The hotel has a beautiful infinity pool and rooftop terrace for taking in the view, as well as its own restaurant and bar. There’s no breakfast offered on-site, but there are plenty of places nearby. This is a great choice for a no-frills stay in a more off-the-beaten-path area of the city.
Book here!

  5. York Hotel

This four-star hotel is located just off Orchard Road, famous for its many stores and shopping malls that line the street from beginning to end. York Hotel has a large outdoor pool, a fitness center, and a restaurant that serves an expansive breakfast buffet every day (there’s even an omelet station).
The rooms and bathrooms are both a bit dated but are quite spacious, which is rare in a city as compact as Singapore. Rooms feature a minibar, coffee/tea maker, armchairs, a desk, and plush bathrobes and slippers. While this hotel isn’t anything groundbreaking, most of the hotels in the area are quite pricey. I think you get an excellent value here. It’s a great option for those that want to be in a central location for a decent price.

Travel,1806,"THE 8 BEST HOTELS IN PARIS

Posted: 3/7/24 | March 7th, 2024
Paris is one of my favorite cities in the world. It’s a city I’ve visited countless times, I lived there, I’ve run tours there. I’m one of those people who thinks it lives up to all the hype.
But, it’s also a huge, sprawling city with 20 different neighborhoods and hundreds of hotels (here’s my neighborhood by neighborhood breakdown of the city).
I field a lot of questions on what area of the city to stay in (answered in the above post).
But, in this post, I want to talk about my favorite hotels. I’ve stayed in hundreds of hotels in Paris. Some good, some really terrible. To help you plan your trip, here’s my list of the best hotels in Paris:
1. Hotel Bar Paris Bastille

I love the location of this hotel: it’s literally right across from the Bastille. A three-star boutique hotel, the sleek rooms have modern and minimalist décor, but they’re not super large. They are really well designed though, using the space efficiently so you won’t feel cramped. They also have excellent soundproofing, lots of natural light thanks to the large windows, as well as flatscreen TVs, AC, a kettle, and free Wi-Fi. The bathrooms, while small, have great water pressure.
I think this is one of the best value places in the area. It has a bar on the ground floor that’s perfect for unwinding after a day of exploring. It also serves a delicious breakfast spread, with lots of variety (including fresh bread and croissants, pancakes, eggs, and cheese).
Book here!

  2. Hôtel Minerve

Located near Notre Dame and the Sorbonne, this three-star hotel is housed inside a historic 1864 Haussmannian building complete with flowered balconies. The historic interior features exposed stone walls, visible wood beams, and original artwork throughout. I really like the excellent breakfast spread each morning (for an additional cost) that includes lots of cheese, meats, and fresh fruit.
The recently refurbished rooms are small but comfortable and include common perks like a flatscreen TV, desk, AC, and free Wi-Fi. The bathrooms, while also small, are pristine and have rainfall showers with excellent water pressure. The rooms are well soundproofed too, though the hotel is on a quieter street so there’s little traffic noise. I think this is the best budget choice for travelers who want something affordable but prefer not to stay in a hostel.
Book here!

  3. Pavillon de la Reine

Pavillon de la Reine is a five-star hotel in the Place des Vosges, one of the most beautiful and oldest squares in the world. The hotel used to be the residence of Queen Anne of Austria. The vine-covered 17th-century building is gorgeous, with a beautiful inner courtyard garden and a spa featuring a hammam, hot tub, and fitness center.
The rooms are all uniquely and lavishly decorated, with aristocratic furnishings like elaborate chandeliers and fine art on the fabric-coated walls. All rooms are comfortable and quiet, and while they aren’t huge, they offer lots of natural light from the enormous windows. Each room has AC, free Wi-Fi, a minibar, desk, and flatscreen TV. The bathrooms are spacious and feature elegant tiles as well as upscale bath products. Breakfast isn’t included, and while it’s not cheap it is exceptional (the on-site Michelin-starred restaurant is worth a visit if you want to splash out). Paris has some luxury places and I think this is one of the best if you’re looking to spend some dough.
Book here!

  4. Le Relais Montmartre

This cute four-star hotel is on a quiet street in Montmartre, one of my favorite areas of the city. The rooms have a rustic charm, with exposed beams and vintage furniture. They also feature soft pastel colors and floral fabrics, creating a relaxing atmosphere for your stay. A continental breakfast is served each morning, and while it’s not included in the price, it is served in a really cozy vaulted cellar below the hotel.
Like most hotels in Paris, the rooms here aren’t huge, but they are colorful and bright. They also include free Wi-Fi, a coffee/tea maker, minibar, desk, and flatscreen TV. The bathrooms are a bit dated, but everything is clean and the water pressure is great. The hotel is just a three-minute walk to the Moulin Rouge too, so you really can’t beat this location. It’s also one of the most affordable hotels in the area, especially for the class of service you get.
Book here!

  5. Hôtel Wyld Saint Germain

This boutique three-star hotel is super stylish. Each air-conditioned room is decorated with bright pops of color, such as colorful duvets or bright murals on the walls (some rooms even have colored lights). There’s a distinct arty flair to the décor. It’s just a short walk to the Pantheon and Notre Dame, and there’s a simple continental breakfast with fresh daily croissants available (for an additional charge, although it’s a pretty good value).
Rooms feature a flatscreen TV, electric kettle, and free Wi-Fi. They’re not huge, but they are well-designed and have everything you need for a comfortable stay. Some rooms also have balconies. The bathrooms, while also small, have modern fixtures and colorful tiles. The showers have good water pressure too.
Book here!

    6. Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel

This four-star hotel sits in the shadow of the Eiffel Tower. You literally can’t stay much closer than this (some rooms even have balconies looking out at the tower). The hotel is modern and minimalist, and everything is sleek and spotless. There’s a stylish restaurant on-site (where you can get breakfast in the mornings), as well as a wine bar. Both feature lots of greenery and plants that really brighten up the space. The hotel has a fitness center too (open 24/7).
Decorated in a contemporary style, rooms feature comfy beds, a desk, flatscreen TVs with Chromecast, Nespresso machines, Alexa docking stations, and plush bathrobes. The bathrooms are large, with roomy walk-in rain showers that have excellent water pressure. If you want to stay near the Eiffel Tower, stay here.
Book here!
7. Hôtel Thérèse

This four-star boutique hotel is in a restored 18th-century building in central Paris. A family-run business, the hotel is cozy and welcoming (the staff really go above and beyond). I appreciate the hotel’s attention to sustainability, the stylish decor, and the incredible breakfast. It features an awesome selection of freshly baked pastries, artisanal cheeses, fruit, eggs, and yogurt.
The rooms are compact (but that’s to be expected in such a central location) and feature classy décor with unique artwork curated by the owners. All rooms include a desk, Bluetooth speakers, flatscreen TV with Chromecast, a minibar, and plush bathrobes. The bathrooms are also quite small, but they’re sparkling clean with walk-in showers and luxury bath products. It’s one of my absolute favorite places to stay in the city.
Book here!

  8. Hotel du Louvre

This five-star hotel is also in a historic building in central Paris (it’s literally across the street from the Louvre). It’s a Hyatt property (use points if you can) and was recently renovated. The lobby is stately and grand, with marble floors and high ceilings. There’s a traditional brasserie on-site that serves an excellent breakfast in the mornings too. There’s also a chic cocktail lounge that serves botanical drinks and seasonal dishes under a beautiful glass roof. Twice a week, there’s live jazz here as well (a big plus in my book).
The rooms are stylishly decorated and bright and airy thanks to the large windows. They’re well insulated too so you don’t hear a lot of noise from the street. All rooms have a mini fridge, a minibar, flatscreen TV, electric kettle and Nespresso machine, and a desk. The bathrooms are huge with luxury bath products, robes, and slippers. This is a really nice choice for a higher-end stay in the heart of the city.

Travel,1616,"THE 7 BEST HOTELS IN NEW YORK CITY

Posted: 3/7/24 | March 7th, 2024
New York City is the most iconic and most visited city in the United States. With its distinctive skyline, diverse neighborhoods, world-class museums, incredible Broadway productions, and melting pot of cultures, NYC attracts millions of visitors each year. (It’s also the place I call home.)
New York City is huge. I mean ten million people live here. Where do you stay when you’re here? There’s so many hotels to choose from.
To help you plan your visit and narrow down your options, here’s my list of the best hotels in NYC:
1. East Village Hotel

Located in the East Village, my absolute favorite neighborhood in NYC, this boutique apart-hotel is run more like an Airbnb than a traditional hotel. You get sent a code before arrival to check in and there’s no staff or restaurant on site (though an outpost of The Bean, a popular NYC café, is right downstairs). The studio apartments are designed to reflect the neighborhood’s bohemian spirit, with contemporary artistic décor, beautiful exposed brick walls, and lots of natural light. The kitchenettes include a stovetop, refrigerator, microwave, dishwasher, and silverware.
Rooms include comfy pillowtop beds, showers with good water pressure, a flatscreen TV, and complimentary bath products. Everything is pretty compact, but in an area with few hotels, this is one of the best value spots. Stay here if you want to be in a central location with tons of great restaurants and bars at your fingertips.
Book here!

  2. The Marlton

Originally built in 1900, this historic boutique hotel in Greenwich Village has been home to many of the area’s bohemian set, including one of my favorite writers, Jack Kerouac (he even penned a few novellas here). I like that the hotel’s extensive renovations still kept its classic aesthetic. The beautiful interior has a stately feel, with ornate moldings, herringbone parquet floors, and vintage furnishings like brass light fixtures, ornate rugs, and custom-made furniture. The staff are super friendly too.
The rooms are pretty small, but well designed to make use of the space. They come with flatscreen TVs, comfy beds with plush bedding, wardrobes, minibars, and marble bathrooms. The Marlton is also home to an excellent bar that serves incredible cocktails, and there’s a complimentary breakfast available too. I think it’s the best value for your money in the area.
Book here!

  3. voco The Franklin

This three-star hotel is in a 19th-century brownstone in the Upper East Side, the neighborhood I live in (if you see me, say hi!). The rooms here are simple, but the hotel has some great perks, like a free 24-hour espresso bar and a standard late checkout time (12pm). The restaurant is currently being renovated so there’s no breakfast available on-site, but there are tons of places just steps away.
The rooms are decorated in a minimal (but cozy) style, with white-painted chandeliers and cute original art. All rooms come with large TVs and comfy pillow-top mattresses, while their larger rooms come with a desk and easy chair. Everything is newly renovated, and the glass-enclosed showers have excellent pressure. The location is great too as it’s on a quiet, leafy street close to Central Park and Museum Mile.
Book here!

  4. Hotel Indigo

This four-star hotel is dedicated to supporting local street art and artists, and you’ll see plenty of their work throughout the building. The rooftop bar, Mr. Purple, is a favorite among locals for fancy cocktails, and on the weekends, the area turns into an upscale club. (Because of that, it’s a 21+ hotel). There’s even a heated pool on the rooftop too.
The rooms boast hardwood floors, bold artwork, and floor-to-ceiling windows with impressive views over the city. All rooms also include Keurig machines, desks, and a minibar (for which you get a $20 USD credit). The bathrooms are large, beautifully tiled, and feature rainfall shower heads. While there’s no breakfast served on site, you’re just steps away from tons of great eateries open at all hours. Overall, I think this hotel is the best place to stay if you want to experience NYC’s legendary nightlife.
Book here!

  5. The Standard

The Standard is one of the best hotels in the city (I think this East Side location is even better than the one in the Meatpacking district). The bar serves some of the best drinks in town and is usually always packed with NY’s fashionable set. There’s a café where you can get breakfast in the mornings too.
The recently renovated rooms are gorgeous, decorated in a minimal design with bright pops of color and lots of natural light thanks to the floor-to-ceiling windows. They’re pretty big too, especially by NYC standards. All rooms at this four-star hotel feature plush beds, fluffy down pillows, huge flatscreen TVs, Bluetooth speakers, cozy bathrobes, work desks, and stocked minibars. The bathrooms are spacious, with tiled walk-in showers and organic designer toiletries. You’ll also get complimentary access to the nearby Crunch gym (in case you want to work off all the delicious food from the plethora of nearby restaurants).
Book here!

  6. The Library Hotel

Everything at this four-star hotel is book related. Each of the ten floors has a different theme, and all of the 60 rooms have dozens of books that fit within that theme (the hotel has a collection of over 6,000 books!). There’s also a Reading Room lounge with work desks, cozy nooks for reading or writing, and 24/7 coffee, tea, snacks, and drinks.
Guest rooms are a good size (for NYC) and feature rich wood furnishings in a sleek, contemporary design, with plush bedding, minibars, flatscreen TVs, desks, and luxury bath products. There’s also free breakfast, a rooftop terrace with a bar that serves literary themed drinks, and really helpful staff. It’s a quiet respite from an otherwise busy and loud neighborhood. Stay here for a unique experience that’s close to major tourist sites like Times Square, the Empire State Building, and Grand Central Station.
Book here!

  7. The Sherry-Netherland

Located on Fifth Avenue right across from Central Park, this ornate five-star hotel is housed in a stunning Beaux-Arts building. The lobby boasts vaulted, painted ceilings, custom-made chandeliers, and the elevator even has a white-gloved operator, just to highlight how upscale this property is. The property’s Italian restaurant serves breakfast in the mornings and there’s a fitness center available too.
The spacious rooms are elegantly decorated, with mahogany desks, tasteful art on the walls, and large marble bathrooms. All rooms include flatscreen TVs, luxury bath products, complimentary soda, mineral water, and chocolates, and daily newspaper delivery. This is the place to stay if you want to splash out on a classy and timeless NYC hotel experience.

The upgraded version of the Chase Sapphire Preferred®, the is my one of my favorite premium cards. It offers a lot of fantastic perks for avid travelers.
While The Platinum Card® from American Express gets all the fanfare in terms of luxury rewards cards, I personally prefer the Chase Sapphire Reserve®. It comes with better points-earning bonus categories; more practical, everyday perks (which I’ll get into below); and more comprehensive travel insurance.
Today, I want to share a bit more about this card so you can determine whether it’s the right card for you.

Who Is the Chase Sapphire Reserve® For?

  What is the Chase Sapphire Reserve®?
The (often referred to as CSR) is a travel rewards card issued by Chase. The card comes with a $550 USD annual fee and a host of benefits like lounge access, travel insurance, and an array of statement credits. When used right, these benefits can be worth much more than the annual fee.
One of those benefits is a $300 USD annual travel credit that is very easy to get, effectively reducing the annual fee to a more reasonable $250 USD. You don’t need to do anything extreme to receive this benefit either; the first $300 USD per year that you spend on travel is simply erased from your statement.
Chase also has a very broad definition of what it classifies as travel, making it easy to take advantage of this credit (even parking garages count towards it). According to Chase, they classify travel purchases as including:
“airlines, hotels, motels, timeshares, car rental agencies, cruise lines, travel agencies, discount travel sites, campgrounds and operators of passenger trains, buses, taxis, limousines, ferries, toll bridges and highways, and parking lots and garages.”
So, the first $300 USD of purchases you make in any of these categories will be removed from your statement, and after that, you’ll earn 3x points on these purchases.
And that’s just one benefit of the card. With this card, you can earn:
$300 annual travel credit
3x points on travel (earned after earning your $300 annual travel credit)
3x points on dining, including eligible delivery services and takeout
5x points on flights when booked through Chase Travel(SM)
10x points on hotels and rental cars when booked through Chase Travel(SM)
10x points on Lyft + 2-year Lyft Pink membership
Priority Pass Membership and access to Sapphire Lounges by The Club
Up to $100 credit toward Global Entry or TSA Pre-Check every 4 years
1 year of complimentary Instacart+ membership (includes up to $15 in statement credits each month through July 2024)
Complimentary DashPass membership (includes $5 in DoorDash credits each month)
Travel insurance including emergency medical and dental coverage, emergency evacuation insurance, trip delay coverage, primary car rental insurance, lost luggage reimbursement, and trip cancellation insurance
No foreign transaction fees
Chase Sapphire Reserve® Travel Insurance
The also offers the most comprehensive travel insurance out of any credit card and is one of the only ones to include any kind of medical insurance. It’s my top pick as the best credit card for travel insurance.
As a Visa Infinite® card, the card’s travel insurance includes the following:
Primary car rental insurance up to $75,000 USD
Travel accident insurance up to $1,000,000 USD
Trip cancelation/interruption coverage up to $10,000 USD per person and $20,000 USD per trip
Trip delay coverage of $500 USD after delays of six hours or more
Lost luggage coverage up to $3,000 USD
$100 per day for up to five days if your baggage is delayed
Emergency medical and dental coverage up to $2,500 USD for treatment (minus a $50 USD deductible)
Emergency evacuation insurance up to $100,000 USD
While I always recommend purchasing a separate travel insurance policy, having coverage through your credit card is an added benefit that you get at no additional cost.
Using Your Chase Ultimate Rewards® Points
With this card, you’ll earn Chase Ultimate Rewards® points. You can use those points like you would any other rewards program: to get cash back, book travel directly, or transfer them to travel partners. You can also redeem them for Amazon or Apple purchases, but these are bad redemption values and I would not recommend using points this way.
The easiest option is to redeem your points for travel in the Chase Travel portal, which works like booking through Expedia or any other online travel agency. When you do this, you’re basically using your points as cash, at a value of 1.5 cents per point. So, for example, if you have 50,000 points, they’ll be worth 75,000 points when redeemed through the portal. This is a better value than if you simply redeem your points directly as cash, as you’ll only get a value of 1 cent per point that way.
Using your points in the Chase Travel portal is very straightforward, making it an attractive option for points and miles newbies. If this is the only way that you’ll use your points, then using them is better than letting them sit around!
Just know that there are pros and cons to using the travel portal. Namely, you can usually get more for your points when you transfer them to Chase’s 14 transfer partners (which is what you should be doing with your points).
Taking Advantage of Chase’s Transfer Partners
The ability to transfer to its partners is what makes Chase Ultimate Rewards® points so valuable. You can usually find airline and hotel redemptions where you can get much more than 1.5 cents per point. While the actual value you can get varies greatly based on flight or hotel, a good benchmark is The Points Guy’s monthly valuation chart, which values Chase Ultimate Rewards® points at over 2 cents per point when used as transferable points.
To give a real-life example, the 50,000 points from the example above could be an off-peak, round-trip economy fare from New York to Paris when redeemed through the Chase Travel portal. But if you transfer points to one of Chase’s partner airlines, you can take advantage of flash deals and saver space, potentially finding the same fare for up to 50% less points. Unless it’s a super cheap flight or hotel room (less than $150 USD), I always transfer points to their travel partners, especially when booking business class flights or fancy hotel rooms. You just get more bang for your buck.
Transferring to airline and hotel partners is a bit more work than using the portal, but there are more tools than ever to help you maximize your points. For example, you can use point.me for finding flights with points and Awayz for finding award hotel stays.
Chase’s current transfer partners are:
Airline Transfer Partners:
Aer Lingus, AerClub
Air Canada Aeroplan
British Airways Executive Club
Emirates Skywards®
Flying Blue AIR FRANCE KLM
Iberia Plus
JetBlue TrueBlue
Singapore Airlines KrisFlyer
Southwest Airlines Rapid Rewards®
United MileagePlus®
Virgin Atlantic Flying Club
Hotel Travel Partners:
IHG® Rewards Club
Marriott Bonvoy®
World of Hyatt®
Chase Sapphire Reserve® vs Chase Sapphire Preferred®
By this point, you might be wondering what makes this card different from its sibling, the Chase Sapphire Preferred®. Both cards currently have the same welcome offer: 60,000 points after you spend $4,000 in the first 3 months of account opening. Both also earn 3x points on dining. You also get travel insurance with both cards, though the insurance offered with the Reserve is much more comprehensive.
Given all that, is the Reserve really worth the higher annual fee?
Ultimately, that’s up to you to decide based on your spending, travel habits, and whether you value the Reserve’s extra perks and benefits. But keep in mind that the real difference in cost between these two cards is only $155 USD per year. Sure, that’s considering the $300 USD annual travel credit on the Reserve, but I’m guessing that anyone thinking of getting a travel rewards card spends at least $300 USD on travel per year. And if you do, you’re likely to come out ahead with the Chase Sapphire Reserve® due to the ability to earn points faster, use statement credits, and take advantage of luxury perks like airport lounge access.
Here’s a quick cheat sheet of the main differences:
Chase Sapphire Reserve®:
Chase Sapphire Preferred®
$550 annual fee
$95 annual fee
$300 annual travel credit
$50 annual Ultimate Rewards hotel credit
3x points on travel
2x points on travel
3x points on dining

Travel,1389,"THE 7 BEST HOTELS IN SYDNEY

Posted: 3/1/2024 | March 1st, 2024
Sydney is where most travelers start their trip to Australia. It’s the country’s largest city (almost 20% of the entire population lives here), boasting incredible beaches, a fun nightlife, and lots of museums and galleries.
I’ve been visiting the city since 2007 and always have an amazing time. Sydney is gorgeous and I never get tired of admiring the Opera House and Harbour Bridge. But while the city has plenty to keep you busy, it is a bit spread out. That means picking the right place to stay is important.
Over the years, I’ve stayed at countless hotels. There’s a lot in the city and picking one can be overwhelming. Here’s my list of the best hotels in Sydney:
1. Mercantile Hotel

Located in the historic Rocks neighborhood, this three-star hotel is just five minutes walk from the iconic Opera House and Harbour Bridge. I especially like that it’s home to Australia’s longest-running Irish pub, where you can enjoy regular live music along with your pint.
A mid-range hotel, the rooms here are simple, minimalist, and practical. While it’s not super arty or unique, the rooms are large and the beds are comfortable. There’s free Wi-Fi, AC, and a coffee/tea maker in each room too. The bathrooms, while small, are well-kept and everything is in good condition. There’s no breakfast available, but there are lots of options nearby. The emphasis here is more on location than amenities, but you still get good value. It’s the best place to stay in The Rocks on a budget.
Book here!

  2. Coogee Bay Boutique Hotel

This breezy four-star hotel is in Coogee Bay, a beachy neighborhood southeast of the city. I love that the hotel is just a two-minute walk to the beach. All the rooms here are spacious and airy, with beachy colors and decorations. Rooms also have flatscreen TVs, desks, coffee/tea makers, and minibars. The bathrooms are roomy too, with showers that have good water pressure.
Breakfast is served at the hotel’s beachside bar and grill, and the hotel also has an art-deco style cocktail bar and sports bar. If you have a vehicle, there’s private parking too (which is rare in the city). If you want a quieter, more relaxing stay, this is the hotel for you.
Book here!

  3. Crystalbrook Albion

South of downtown in Surry Hills, this five-star luxury hotel is located in a gorgeous brick heritage building that was once a former convent. The property is elegantly designed, taking inspiration from both the 20’s and the 70s. The result is eclectic yet chic. I especially like all the colorful artwork in the lobby, lounge, and halls.
Each room is unique, but all are bright and airy, with lots of natural light. The beds are large and comfy, and rooms also have flatscreen TVs, desks, coffee/tea makers, and plush bathrobes. The bathrooms are also spacious and bright, with large rain showers and boutique design touches like colorfully tiled walls. There’s a cool rooftop terrace too, and the breakfast each morning includes lots of fresh pastries. I think this is a gorgeous, stylish hotel, perfect if you want to splash out.
Book here!

  4. Glasgow Arms Hotel

This hotel is located above a beautiful old pub. It’s not particularly stylish and the design is a bit dated, but there’s a free continental breakfast served each morning and the hotel is just a five-minute walk from Darling Harbour. It’s more of a no-frills place to crash, the pub food is excellent, and the staff go above and beyond to make you feel welcome.
The rooms, while not particularly large, are bright and have lots of natural light. There’s a desk, flatscreen TV, and free Wi-Fi in each. The bathrooms are on the smaller side but have nice showers with great water pressure. Everything is clean and comfortable, making this a good choice for travelers looking for value and simplicity.
Book here!

  5. The Darling at The Star

This is a massive five-star hotel home to a spa, casino, and over 20 bars and restaurants. I really like that they have a Turkish bath, but there’s also a heated outdoor swimming pool (which has its own bar). The breakfast doesn’t have a ton of options, but what is on offer is exceptional. The hotel also has a valet service if you have a vehicle. Overall, it has more of a resort atmosphere than a regular hotel.
The rooms are large and spacious, with lots of natural light. They have a sleek, modern design and feature tons of perks, including flatscreen TVs, minibars, desks, plush bathrobes, and Egyptian cotton sheets. The bathrooms are also bright and spacious, with marble features and huge bathtubs. If you want luxury in the heart of the city, this is the hotel for you.
Book here!

  6. Hotel Bondi

This three-star boutique hotel has both private and shared balconies with sprawling views overlooking the popular Bondi Beach. Everything is modern and the design has a simple, minimalist feel. The rooms are large and bright and include everything you need (Wi-Fi, desk, TV, coffee/tea maker). There are deluxe rooms with kitchen facilities too, if you want to cook your own meals (though there’s also a restaurant on-site).
While the hotel itself isn’t anything to write home about, the price for the location is fantastic. After all, Bondi Beach is right across the street!
Book here!

  7. Sydney Potts Point

This four-star apartment hotel boasts a rooftop terrace with views over the city and is located just five-minutes from the rambunctious nightlife of Kings Cross. Most of the rooms have kitchenettes and there are also BBQ facilities on the rooftop if you want to cook outdoors. As for amenities, rooms have a desk, fridge, flatscreen TV, and coffee/tea maker. The beds have thick mattresses and are really comfy. The rooms have lots of space and light too (the bathrooms are kind of small though). There’s no breakfast offered, but with a kitchenette, you can easily prepare your own food.
It’s not super fancy place, but everything is well-maintained and there’s even some art in each room. I like that everything feels modern and clean here.

Travel,1263,"THE 7 BEST HOTELS IN DUBLIN

Posted: 3/1/2024 | March 1st, 2024
Dublin is a moody, literary city. It’s a great city for history buffs and book lovers as it is home to lots of authors and poets. Here, you’ll find castles, traditional pubs, and countless opportunities to experience live music.
Dublin is fairly compact, making all the sights, activities, and walking tours easy to do. You can get pretty much anywhere on foot.
Therefore, when you’re thinking of a hotel, don’t worry too much about where it is located (unless it’s far from the center). The city’s tram system makes it easy to get around too.
Here’s my list of the best hotels in Dublin:
1. Harcourt Hotel

Located in the center of the city, this three-star hotel is housed in a series of historic 18th-century Georgian townhouses, one of which was once the home of famed writer George Bernard Shaw. There’s a bar on-site that regularly hosts live music, as well as both a restaurant and a beer garden. The rooms, while not huge, feature nice touches of color that brighten up the space, have lots of natural light, as well as wooden accenting. The beds are comfy and there’s a flatscreen TV, desk, and free Wi-Fi in each room. While the bathrooms are on the smaller side, the water pressure is great (a big plus in my book). There’s an included breakfast too.
Book here!

  2. Clarence Hotel

Located in the boisterous Temple Bar area, this hotel was bought by Bono and the Edge from U2 in 1992. It was completely renovated a few years later and is considered one of the coolest places to stay in the city (though it’s no longer owned by the duo). A boutique four-star property, the hotel has an arty, quirky design that features lots of colorful art and wallpaper. The rooms were designed by Irish artisans and feature stylish custom furnishings like white oak floors, colorful and plush headboards, and unique artwork on the walls. The bathrooms have powerful rainfall shower heads as well as limestone flooring and tiled walls. In-room amenities include the standard offerings (flatscreen TV, desk, minibar, coffee/tea maker, desks).
Downstairs, there’s a luxurious cocktail bar and a fantastic restaurant serving elevated Irish fare, including daily breakfast and a bottomless brunch on Sundays.
Book here!

  3. Maldron Hotel Kevin Street

With a view of St. Patrick’s Cathedral, the Maldron is a cozy place to stay right on the edge of the Portobello neighborhood. It’s a sleek four-star hotel with a simple, minimalist design. The rooms are large with lots of natural light, and the beds are large and comfortable. You also get flatscreen TVs, coffee/tea maker, desks, and free Wi-Fi. The bathrooms are spacious with showers that have good water pressure. I love the breakfast buffet, which had tons of variety and lots of fresh fruit. It’s a great place to stay if you want to be centrally located.
Book here!

  4. The Dean

This is a hip and funky boutique hotel. The rooms aren’t huge, but they’re bright and uniquely designed with colorful furnishings and artwork on the walls. All rooms include a flatscreen smart TV (with streaming services), minibar, Nespresso machines, desk, and free Wi-Fi. The white-tiled bathrooms come with powerful rainfall showers, Bluetooth speakers, and lux bath products.
I also love the chill rooftop bar/restaurant with it’s view of the city. There’s also a sauna and a heated outdoor pool. Overall, you really get a lot of value here, considering the amenities and central location.
Book here!

  5. The Alex

Just south of the Docklands, this is a comfortable and stylish four-star hotel. The rooms here are sleek with rich, deep colors and elegant design touches (like artwork and wooden desks). The beds are large and comfortable, and rooms also boast large smart TVs, desks, and fast Wi-Fi. While the standard rooms don’t have a coffee/tea maker, there is a café on-site where you can grab a drink. I especially liked the rainfall showers as they had great pressure.
The staff here really go out of their way to help and keep things clean (the property is always spotless). The hotel also has a fitness center and a few excellent in-house eateries. The buffet breakfast (which can be included in your stay) has a ton of options too.
Book here!

  6. The Spencer Hotel

This four-star hotel overlooks the river and boasts an array of upscale amenities, including an indoor pool, fitness center, cocktail bar, and cozy restaurant. The breakfast is great too, with lots of variety (including veg options). If you happen to be traveling by car, they have a secure parking lot on-site (which isn’t common in Dublin).
Rooms here are spacious and minimally designed in a soft, pastel color palate. They have lots of natural light too, thanks to the floor-to-ceiling windows. The bathrooms are also large, with a shower/tub combo and complimentary Rituals bath products. Rooms also have a mini-fridge and a coffee/tea maker. It’s a classy property that offers excellent value for your money.
Book here!

  7. The Hendrick Smithfield

This fun and quirky three-star hotel is covered artwork by local artists. The rooms aren’t huge, but they make good use of the space and have all the standard amenities, including flatscreen TVs, coffee/tea makers, desk, and Wi-Fi. Some rooms even have bunk beds, which makes it a nice choice for traveling families. The bathrooms are well-lit and the showers have good pressure. There’s a bar on-site if you get thirsty, with over a dozen beers on tap. The Hendrick is a solid midrange option in Smithfield, a less-touristed and hip area of the city with great pubs and cool coffee shops.

Book Your Flight
Use Skyscanner to find a cheap flight. They are my favorite search engine because they search websites and airlines around the globe so you always know no stone is left unturned.
Book Your Accommodation
You can book your hostel with Hostelworld as they have the biggest inventory and best deals. If you want to stay somewhere other than a hostel, use Booking.com as they consistently return the cheapest rates for guesthouses and cheap hotels.
Don’t Forget Travel Insurance
Travel insurance will protect you against illness, injury, theft, and cancellations. It’s comprehensive protection in case anything goes wrong. I never go on a trip without it as I’ve had to use it many times in the past. My favorite companies that offer the best service and value are:
Safety Wing (best for everyone)
Insure My Trip (for those over 70)
Medjet (for additional evacuation coverage)
